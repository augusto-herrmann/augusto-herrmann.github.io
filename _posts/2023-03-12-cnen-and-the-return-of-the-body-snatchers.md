  The National Nuclear Energy Commission in Brazil has opened a public
  consultation for allowing and regulating the use of body scanners
  using ionizing radiation for public security purposes. The machines
  have already spurred much controversy in other countries and are shown
  to be ineffective for that purpose and are quite expensive.

Air travel gets to be a worse experience for travelers with every passing
year. Steadily and starkly rising prices and separately charging for each
and every idea companies can come up with for getting more money. Airport
security keeps getting more inconvenient procedures and passengers get
less and less comfort and privacy. Kiosks and self-service machines for
everything replacing human services. Luggage conveyor belts that drop
your suitcase from a storey high and break it.
[Mandatory facial recognition systems](https://www.techdirt.com/2023/01/04/tsas-opt-in-facial-recognition-program-doesnt-seem-all-that-optional-in-real-life/)
as replacement for boarding passes that
[do not disclose what they do with your photo or how long they keep it once they take it](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:ugcPost:6901893550540476417?commentUrn=urn%3Ali%3Acomment%3A%28ugcPost%3A6901893550540476417%2C6906049974652788736%29).

When a bad novelty appears in other countries, some agency decides years
later it's time to bring it to Brazil, too.

## The public consultation

The
[National Nuclear Energy Commission](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Nuclear_Energy_Commission)
(CNEN in the Portuguese acronym) is the Brazilian government agency
responsible for orientation, planning, supervision, and control of the
Brazil's nuclear program.

Last Monday, CNEN has opened
[a public consultation](https://www.gov.br/participamaisbrasil/norma-cnen-nn-614)
in favor of allowing and regulating the use for public security purposes
of body scanners that use ionizing radiation.

Such machines have been used in the past in some countries, including
the United States, not without much controversy around its 
[lack of effectiveness](https://americablog.com/2010/01/german-tv-highlights-failings-of-body-scanners.html), invasiveness and health hazards.

## What are body scanners

[Body scanning technology for security screening](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_body_scanner)
commonly use some sort of radiation that penetrates clothes and capture
reflections upon the skin surface to generate a body image. As clothes
are transparent to the radiation, the body images they generate are very
similar to what the person would look like when nude.

The stated purpose of such equipment is to find items concealed beneath
clothes, such as weapons. It is sometimes deployed in places where
security screenings are required, such as airports.

Scanners usually resemble a small room or platform, where the person must
stand in the designated spot in the center and are instructed to hold
their arms up in the air for the duration of the procedure.

### Types of scanners

Two major categories of body scanners have been deployed at airports:
[backscatter x-ray](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backscatter_X-ray) and
[millimeter wave scanners](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millimeter_wave_scanner).
The former utilizes ionizing radiation, the latter a type of microwave,
non-ionizing radiation. The former builds a 2D image of the body, while
the latter constructs a 3D image. Both pose different levels of health
hazards and privacy concerns.

Less common than those are **transmission x-ray scanners** that use
a higher dose of penetrating radiation that passes through the human
body and is captured by an array of receptors. Like a medical x-ray,
those scanners show inside the body, so they can show objects hidden
in body cavities or that have been surgically implanted. They are
[alleged to have been deployed in Ghana and Nigeria](https://www.aclu.org/news/national-security/us-encouraging-use-radiation-africans)
and are
[official security screening policy in some prison systems](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/x-ray-scanners-stop-over-1-000-illegal-items-entering-prisons).
Because of the high dose of radiation, this type os scanner is also the
one that offers the greatest health risk to the person being scanned. In
this setup, the law usually requires that the cumulative annual dose
applied to each subject be tracked and prohibit exposure above a certain
limit.

There are also body scanners based on passively collecting infrared
light emitted by body heat, which is blocked by concealed weapons
beneath clothes. This type of scanner usually does not show off any
intimate body parts and were apparently
[being tested in 2019 at a London rail station](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-49718751).
Because this type of body scanner emits no radiation, it is generally
considered safe of health concerns. They are similar to the thermal
image cameras that have been used to try to detect fever in passengers
[in an attempt to deter the spread of Covid](https://www.bbc.com/news/health-52940951)
since 2020. Even though they have
[not been effective for that particular purpose]((https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/general-hospital-devices-and-supplies/thermal-imaging-systems-infrared-thermographic-systems-thermal-imaging-cameras)),
they could be a safer option for security screening, concerning health
and privacy.

The CNEN proposal does not mention any of those types, but since it
specifically regulates only equipment using ionizing radiation, we can
only deduce that they intend either:

* to allow the old backscatter x-ray body scanners to come to Brazil,
* to allow the use of transmission x-ray body scanners in Brazil, or
* they are willing to let manufacturers use Brazil as a testing ground to
  experiment with new types of scanners using ionizing radiation,

or maybe all of the above. In any case, as we will see, **scanners using
ionizing radiation are clearly the ones posing the greatest health
risks**.

### History in airports

Full-body scanners started being deployed in airport security screening
in the United States and in Schiphol airport in the Netherlands in the
late 2000's. The alleged justification was a response to the
[Christmas 2009 attempted bombing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northwest_Airlines_Flight_253)
of Northwest Airlines Flight 253, which fortunately was averted by
**passengers who fought back the perpetrator**. As we'll see, according
to security experts, the willingness of passengers to fight back is one
of the key factors that make flights more secure today.

While the US initially used the backscatter x-ray scanners branded
Rapiscan, the Netherlands have used since the beginning millimeter wave
scanners of the SafeView brand. The US later dropped the Rapiscan
[naked body scanners after the manufacturer failed to make them "less revealing"](https://www.techdirt.com/2013/01/18/tsa-dumps-rapiscan-naked-airport-scanners-after-failure-to-make-them-less-revealing/)
and has been ever since also using exclusively millimeter wave scanners.
Those newer scanners also happen to have software that analyses the
naked image automatically and creates a "paper figure" doll. Security
agents allegedly see only those figures, which indicate places in the
passenger body for further searches. However, as we'll see, even that
type of body scanner has seen its share of controversies.

Despite all controversies, the US has allegedly been supplying Ghana and
Nigeria with see-through, high dosage x-ray full body scanners, that
show inside the body just like a medical x-ray would. The ethics of the
practice have been questioned by many,
[including the American Civil Liberties Union](https://www.aclu.org/news/national-security/us-encouraging-use-radiation-africans)
(ACLU).

In some places, one can opt-out of a full-body scan (but reportedly
[not so in Australia](https://www.lifehacker.com.au/2013/01/you-cant-opt-out-of-airport-body-scans-in-australia/))
and receive a pat down instead. In the Netherlands, this is just a
"normal", unintrusive pat down. In the US, however, since 2010 people who
opt-out of the machines receive an invasive "enhanced pat down" that have
been described as
[akin to sexual assault](https://www.techdirt.com/2017/03/06/tsa-now-making-intrusive-searches-even-more-gropey-assaulty/),
as they involve
[groping of intimate body parts by the security agent](https://www.techdirt.com/2011/04/28/tsa-molests-miss-usa-makes-her-cry-your-safety/).


### Ineffective and expensive

Renowned security expert Bruce Schneier
[often says](https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2010/01/airport_securit_12.html)
that
[only two things have made flying more secure since 9/11](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/posteverything/wp/2018/08/07/dont-fear-the-tsa-cutting-airport-security-be-glad-that-theyre-talking-about-it/):
steel reinforced cockpit doors and teaching passengers that they should
fight back. Many years have passed since airport security measures have
ramped up, and observing the outcome of those measures, he states that
current additional airport security procedures are a waste of time and
money without providing added security. He affirms that the procedures
[should scale down to pre-9/11 levels](https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2015/06/reassessing_air.html).
But why?

For once, he argues that many security measures are effective at stopping
dumb attackers, but they are not as effective at stopping smart
attackers:

> The very rare smart terrorists are going to be able to bypass whatever
> we implement or choose an easier target. The more common stupid
> terrorists are going to be stopped by whatever measures we implement.

There has been ample evidence of the ineffectiveness of such security
measures over the years.

Schneier
[coined in](https://archive.org/details/beyondfearthinki00schn_0/page/38/mode/2up)
the term "[security theater](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_theater)"
for the practice of taking ineffective security measures, for the sole
purpose of reassuring the public, rather than actually preventing or
deterring real threats.

According to him, body scanners are one such example of security theater.
Indeed, there have been several episodes of body scanning technology
being thwarted and people being able to pass security checkpoints with
concealed weapons. In November 2011 a group of researchers published a
paper in the *Journal of Transportation Security* that

> suggested terrorists might fool the Rapiscan machines and others like
> it employing the X-ray "backscatter" technique. A terrorist, the report
> found, could tape a thin film of explosives of about 15-20 centimeters
> in diameter to the stomach and walk through the machine undetected.

as
[reported by Wired magazine](https://www.wired.com/2011/03/scanners-part3/).
Millimeter wave scanners are not in any way more effective. In 2012,
computer scientist, civil rights attorney and blogger Jonathan Corbett
[published video that became viral](https://professional-troublemaker.com/2012/03/06/1b-of-nude-body-scanners-made-worthless-by-blog-how-anyone-can-get-anything-past-the-tsas-nude-body-scanners/)
that demonstrated the
[ineffectiveness of the machines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_body_scanner#Backscatter_and_millimeter)
by

> showing how he was able to get a metal box through backscatter X-ray
> and millimeter wave scanners in two US airports. In April 2012, Corbett
> released a second video interviewing a TSA screener, who described
> firearms and simulated explosives passing through the scanners during
> internal testing and training.

In fact,
[CNN reported that](https://edition.cnn.com/2015/06/01/politics/tsa-failed-undercover-airport-screening-tests/index.html)
the
[Transportation Security Administration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transportation_Security_Administration)
– TSA had failed in detecting threats in screening tests 95% of the time.
Schneier explains that

> For those of us who have been watching the TSA, the 95% number wasn’t
> that much of a surprise. The TSA has been failing these sorts of tests
> since its inception:
> [failures in 2003](https://www.boston.com/news/local/articles/2003/10/16/logan_screeners_fail_weapons_tests),
> a
> [91% failure rate at Newark Liberty International in 2006](http://www.homelandstupidity.us/2006/10/31/tsa-screeners-still-fail-to-find-guns-bombs),

> more

> And those are just the public test results; I’m sure there are many
> more similarly damning reports the TSA has kept secret out of
> embarrassment.

Yet this is even more staggering when you consider that those scanners
have
[cost US$ 150,000 per unit in 2008](https://www.politico.com/story/2015/08/airport-security-price-for-tsa-failed-body-scanners-160-million-121385)
(according to a report by Politico) which, when corrected
by inflation to today's values would be something like US$ 208,000. In
Brazil's currency, that would amount to well over a million BRL **each**.
That's a huge amount of money that, were CNEN to go forth with its
proposal,
[would just be a huge waste of resources](https://www.techdirt.com/2015/08/27/we-should-put-metal-detector-other-side-laughable-waste-tsa-body-scanners/).

And where does all that wasted money go? In the US there has been at least
[one reported case](https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/12/31/AR2009123102821.html)
of
[conflict of interest](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/11/23/fear_pays_chertoff_n_787711.html),
where an individual who was responsible for the department procuring these machines
was also having his private firm profit from them. The case was even
[reprehended by Senator Ron Paul (Rep.-TX) on the House floor](https://youtu.be/drm9fz48mM4?t=273):

<figure markdown="1">

> Michael Chertoff! I mean, here's the guy who was the head of the TSA,

The push for adoption the technology has always been driven by
[corporate lobbyists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_body_scanner#Full-body_scanner_lobbyists).
The sudden interest in bringing those machines to Brazil makes one wonder
whose interests are behind the idea.

[Recent events](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Brazilian_Congress_attack)
in Brazil have made many rethink the notion that the country used to be
far away from concerns with terrorism that have permeated in the global
north for the last 20 years. One might look at the threat and be tempted
to justify the employment of body scanners in order to ramp up security
and prevent threats such as the
[attempted bombing near Brasília International Airport on December 23rd, 2022](https://gnet-research.org/2023/01/23/the-brazilian-far-right-and-the-path-to-january-8th/#),
perpetrated by the same group who would a coupe of weeks later
[storm and ransack the capital's seats of democratic institutions](https://www.dw.com/en/brazil-bolsonaro-supporters-storm-national-congress/a-64320440).

However, the attempt was carried out outside the airport premises and, as
demonstrated above, even if perpetrated inside the airport, body scanners
would not have been useful in preventing it anyway. So that case is
definitely **not a valid argument** in favor of justifying bringing body
scanners to Brazil.


### Health concerns and types of radiation

As previously explained, the two most common body scanner types are
backscatter x-ray scanners, which use ionizing radiation and millimeter
wave scanners, that use non-ionizing radiation.

<figure markdown="1">

<figcaption>Different types of electromagnetic radiation. Credit: <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/User:Spazturtle">Spazturtle</a>, CC-BY-SA 4.0.</figcaption>
</figure>

[Ionizing radiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ionizing_radiation) is
a type of radiation that has enough energy to remove electrons from atoms
and molecules, creating ions. This type of radiation includes gamma rays,
x-rays, and ultraviolet light. Ionizing radiation can cause damage to
living tissue, including DNA mutations and cancer. It is also used in
medical treatments such as radiotherapy and in industrial processes.

[Non-ionizing radiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-ionizing_radiation),
on the other hand, does not have enough energy to remove electrons from
atoms or molecules. This type of radiation includes radio waves,
microwaves, infrared light, and visible light. It does not cause the same
kind of damage as ionizing radiation but can still be harmful if exposed
to high levels for long periods of time. It can cause skin burns, eye
damage, and other health problems. Non-ionizing radiation is used in many
everyday applications such as cell phones, Wi-Fi networks, and television
broadcasts.

The main difference between ionizing and non-ionizing radiation is the
amount of energy they contain. Ionizing radiation has more energy than
non-ionizing radiation and therefore poses a greater health risk. On the
other hand, non-ionizing radiation does not have the same level of risk
but can still be dangerous if exposed to high levels for long periods of
time. In 2011, the World Health Organization (WHO) added radio frequency
electromagnetic fields, including microwave and millimeter waves, such as
those used in the body scanners but also in common equipment like cell
phones and wifi routers, to their
[list of things which can potentially cause cancer on humans](https://www.iarc.who.int/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/pr208_E.pdf).
The classification was done in context of assessing the potential health
risks associated to frequent and extensive cell phone use, but applies to
all radio frequency waves.

Ever since
[the US dropped backscatter x-ray body scanners from their airports](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-01-18/naked-image-scanners-to-be-removed-from-u-s-airports.html),
one could hardly see them used elsewhere in the world. Yet it is exactly
that type of body scanners that CNEN intends to introduce in Brazil.

For exposure to ionizing radiation, the unit of measure is the
[Sievert](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sievert). In the US, there is a
the effective dose allowed for each exposition. Body scanners
[are not allowed be above 250 microsieverts](https://hps.org/documents/securityscreening_ps017-1.pdf).
However, on the regulation CNEN proposes **has no maximum allowed dosage
at all**.

Even considering that, there are reports on
[how the legal limits to ionizing radiation exposure have been breached](https://www.techdirt.com/2010/12/30/tsa-claims-naked-scanners-are-safe-exaggerated-how-they-make-sure-thats-true/),
sometimes exhibiting
[even](https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2011/03/tsa-admits-bungling-of-airport-body-scanner-radiation-tests/)
[tenfold](https://www.techdirt.com/2011/03/14/maintenance-report-shows-radiation-levels-some-tsa-scanners-10-times-higher-than-promised/)
the expected radiation.
So even if the CNEN was to set a limit in regulation, it would be
difficult to ensure that that limit would always be respected.

Even if the limit were to be respected and verified, it's important to
note that, since backscatter x-ray body scanning technology concentrates
energy on the body surface, rather than distributed throughout the whole
body, the effective dose to the skin could be much higher. A number of
researchers at the University of California, San Francisco, (UCSF) have
argued in an
[open letter to the Assistant to the President for Science and Technology](https://legacy.npr.org/assets/news/2010/05/17/concern.pdf)
in April 2010:

> The X-ray dose from these devices has often been compared in the media
> to the cosmic ray exposure inherent to airplane travel or that of a
> chest X-ray. However, this comparison is very misleading: both the air
> travel cosmic ray exposure and chest X- rays have much higher X-ray
> energies and the health consequences are appropriately understood in
> terms of the whole body volume dose. In contrast, these new airport
> scanners are largely depositing their energy into the skin and
> immediately adjacent tissue, and since this is such a small fraction of
> body weight/vol, possibly by one to two orders of magnitude, the real
> dose to the skin is now high.

They were also concerned with possible malfunctions in the equipment
causing spikes of energy dose that could be harmful to the human skin:

> Because this device can scan a human in a few seconds, the X-ray beam
> is very intense. Any glitch in power at any point in the hardware (or
> more importantly in software) that stops the device could cause an
> intense radiation dose to a single spot on the skin.

If backscatter x-ray body scanner technology safety is often brought
into question, it doesn't mean that the other type of body scanning
technology is safe.

Millimeter wave scanners emit non-ionizing radiation in the millimeter
wavelength band, which is a subset of the microwave radio frequency (RF)
spectrum. Microwaves affect water molecules and, depending on the
[energy density](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_density),
it could heat skin and eye tissues and potentially cause burns. While a
[2001 study](https://academic.oup.com/carcin/article/22/10/1701/2733727?login=false)
found no evidence of 94 GHz RF in skin carcinogenesis in animals, a
[2009 study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2822276/)
funded by National Institute of Health, conducted by U.S. Department of
Energy's Los Alamos National Laboratories Theoretical Division and
Center for Nonlinear Studies and Harvard University Medical School
found that

> a specific terahertz radiation exposure may significantly affect the
> [natural dynamics of DNA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sticky_and_blunt_ends#Frayed_ends),
> and thereby influence intricate molecular processes involved in gene
> expression and DNA replication.

Millimiter waves are also present in
[WiGig](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WiGig), also known as 60 GHz Wi-Fi.
A
[recent study](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10762-022-00850-w)
found out that 60 GHz millimeter waves could cause eye injury.

### Privacy concerns and data leaks

Using a full-body scanner has been compared by security experts as
[akin to a strip-search](https://archive.epic.org/privacy/airtravel/backscatter/).
It can be
[described as](https://www.aclu.org/aclu-backgrounder-body-scanners-and-virtual-strip-searches?redirect=technology-and-liberty/aclu-backgrounder-body-scanners-and-virtual-strip-searches)

> a virtual strip search that reveals not only our private body
> parts, but also intimate medical details like colostomy bags.

It can also be especially embarrassing to people who need to use
prosthetics and provoke discrimination against transgender people.

The UK Equality and Human Rights Commission argued in 2010 that full-body
scanners
[were a risk to human rights](https://web.archive.org/web/20100809193539/http://www.equalityhumanrights.com/media-centre/2010/february/commission-issues-warning-over-counter-terrorism-measures/)
and might be breaking the law. As even children are subjected to the
procedure, a UK court has decided that body scanning of children
[violates UK laws against child pornography](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2010/jan/04/new-scanners-child-porn-laws):

> The decision followed a warning from Terri Dowty, of Action for Rights
> of Children, that the scanners could breach the Protection of Children
> Act 1978, under which it is illegal to create an indecent image or a
> "pseudo-image" of a child.

There is also a concern regarding storage and possible leaks of images.
[The ACLU has argued that](https://www.smh.com.au/world/airport-x-ray-labelled-strip-search-20061205-gdoza4.html)

> the machine constitutes an invasion of privacy as it can display
> graphic images of nude bodies and its use could pave the way to
> widespread abuse of the images taken, with some possibly being posted
> or traded on the internet.

In 2012, the TSA decided to dump the Rapiscan machines after
[OSI Systems had allegedly failed to make them "less revealing"](https://www.techdirt.com/2013/01/18/tsa-dumps-rapiscan-naked-airport-scanners-after-failure-to-make-them-less-revealing/).
They instated new body scanners in their place that instead of naked body
image, would supposedly only display on screen a processed doll figure
model, indicating body parts for further screening. Despiting insisting
that the scanners do not store the original naked images generated by the
devices, a
[TSA procurement document obtained through a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request by the Electronic Privacy Information Center](https://archive.epic.org/open_gov/foia/TSA_Procurement_Specs.pdf)
has revealed that they do require that body scanner manufacturers provide
the functions to store and transmit those images. It was later found that
the machines
[did record and store full body scan images](https://www.techdirt.com/2010/08/05/and-of-course-govt-agencies-recorded-and-stored-body-scan-images/).
In response to that, TSA
[claimed it was only used](https://www.techdirt.com/2010/04/12/tsa-admits-that-body-scan-machines-can-record-images/)

> for “testing, training, and evaluation purposes.” However, the TSA also
> admitted that there’s nothing preventing this “test mode” from being
> turned on while in regular use.

Yet, despite those claims,
[Politico has reported that](https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2014/01/tsa-screener-confession-102912/)
a former TSA agent confessed that yes,
[the scanner didn't work, but did let see you naked](https://www.techdirt.com/2014/01/31/former-tsa-agent-explains-full-body-scanners-didnt-work-did-let-him-see-you-naked/):

> We quickly found out the trainer was not kidding: Officers discovered
> that the machines were good at detecting just about everything besides
> cleverly hidden explosives and guns. The only thing more absurd than
> how poorly the full-body scanners performed was the incredible amount
> of time the machines wasted for everyone. 

To add insult to injury, some agents would, according to the report, even
look and laugh at seeing people naked:

> Many of the images we gawked at were of overweight people, their every
> fold and dimple on full awful display. Piercings of every kind were
> visible. Women who’d had mastectomies were easy to discern—their chests
> showed up on our screens as dull, pixelated regions. Hernias appeared
> as bulging, blistery growths in the crotch area.

In 2010,
[Gizmodo investigated the use of body scanners](https://gizmodo.com/one-hundred-naked-citizens-one-hundred-leaked-body-sca-5690749)
by the US Marshals Service and obtained, through a FOIA request, a sample
of 100 images sample out of the 35,000 naked body images they had
obtained through the machine and stored. This has been
[reported as evidence](https://www.nbcnews.com/id/wbna40218074) that the
machines installed in airports and public buildings are indeed capable of
storing the original images. If the images are stored, there always is a
risk of them leaking and exposing the people that have been subjected to
it.


## Categories of scanners proposed by CNEN

The backscatter x-ray type of body scanner uses x-rays, a form of
[ionizing radiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ionizing_radiation)
that has known effects on human cells and increase the risk of
developing cancer. The type of body scanner that CNEN intends to allow
is the one that operates with ionizing radiation. On the public
consultation they are divided in two categories:

* **general usage systems**, for equipment that expose
  people to a dose of ionizing radiation of up to 0.1 µSv per inspection
* **limited usage systems**, for equipment that expose
  people to a dose of ionizing radiation above 0.1 µSv per inspection

The difference between these two categories is that, in "general usage
systems", only individuals from the public who have given explicit
written consent can be screened. For "limited usage systems", however,
besides having a higher dosage of ionizing radiation, no such consent is
required. The bylaw would also require operators in the latter case to
keep track of the annual dosage those people are subjected to.

Those provisions may mean that the first type of system would be deployed
to the general public, while the second is meant for the prison system,
but that is just mere speculation.

### A nonsensical proposal

To sum it up, the type of body scanner technology the CNEN is proposing
is expensive, ineffective, poses serious health risks, invades on
people's bodily privacy and **have been abandoned by the United States and
Europe for more than a decade long**. It makes no sense at all to propose
to bring them to Brazil at this time.

Makes one wonder who is lobbying CNEN in favor of this thing and how much
they have to gain once this expensive and ineffective technology is
procured.

### What can I do to stop it?

Raise awareness, tell your friends, colleagues and acquaintances, share
on social media, mention all of the problems and dangers of body
scanners. It's also important to leave comments on the public
consultation making it clear that using those devices in Brazil is not
acceptable and articulate the reasons why. This article contains plenty
of explanations and references that can be grounds for immediately
rejecting this unreasonable proposal.
