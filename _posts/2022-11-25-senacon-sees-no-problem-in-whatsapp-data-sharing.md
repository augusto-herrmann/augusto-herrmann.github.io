  The consumer protection authority in Brazil, Senacon, has decided in
  favor of Meta. They see no offense to consumer protection legislation
  in WhatsApp's controversial user data sharing practices.

It seems so long ago now, when in the beginning of 2021, WhatsApp, the
leading messenger app in Brazil,
[used daily by 95% of Brazilians](https://canaltech.com.br/apps/95-porcento-dos-brasileiros-que-usam-o-whatsapp-abrem-o-app-todos-os-dias-171055/)
for everything from family chat to commercial transactions, caused a stir
when they decided that they would
[change their privacy policy to share data with its parent company](https://g1.globo.com/economia/tecnologia/noticia/2021/01/06/whatsapp-comeca-a-avisar-que-ira-compartilhar-dados-dos-usuarios-com-o-facebook.ghtml),
then called Facebook, now Meta. Users would be required to accept the new
policy if they wanted to continue using the app.

After the PR disaster this change caused,
[WhatsApp decided then to postpone the change in Brazil](https://www.bbc.com/portuguese/brasil-55680262).
The new rules would also
[not apply to Europe](https://www.bbc.com/portuguese/geral-55606054),
allegedly due to the strong personal data protection framework there.
However, Brazil does have a data protection law very similar to the
European GDPR: the LGPD. As Michel de Souza, director of public policies
of the non-profit Derechos Digitales
[puts it](https://idec.org.br/idec-na-imprensa/whatsapp-mantem-segredo-sobre-dados-compartilhados):

> Our data law is heavily inspired in the European regulation. So why
> don't they apply the same policies here?

Later in 2021 the change went into effect anyway. Anyone who did not opt
out of the data sharing within a 30 day window opened in 2016 is
submitted automatically to the new rules.

[According to Instituto Brasileiro de Defesa do Consumidor – IDEC](https://idec.org.br/dicas-e-direitos/mudanca-na-privacidade-do-whatsapp-e-agora),
(Brazilian Institute for Consumer Protection), a local non-profit CSO
focused on consumer protection, the data sharing violates not only the
LGPD, but also the Brazilian Consumer Protection law, because it
constitutes a "forced consent". In 2016 they produced
[a report](http://www.idec.org.br/pdf/relatorio-whatsapp-termos-de-uso.pdf)
detailing the reasons.

Today, the Secretaria Nacional de Defesa do Consumidor – Senacon
(National Secretariat for Consumer Protection), the federal government
body responsible for enforcing consumer protection in Brazil, has
published in the National Official Gazette a decision regarding the
matter. They say that the WhatsApp data sharing practice **does not**
violate Brazilian consumer protection law and close the case:

> Request for clarifications by this Department of Consumer Protection and
> Defense. Information provided by the ascertained. Absence of violation
> to consumer legislation. Suggestion of closure. Accepting the reasons
> expressed in Technical Note n.º 36/2022/CGCTSA/DPDC/SENACON/MJ (SEI
> 19613859) which become part of the present decision, I determine:
> closure of the present case,

in today's Diário Oficial da União (National Official Gazette), section 1,
page 204.

## Brazilian Government rubber stamping Meta's practices

The decision follows an unfortunate trend of the Brazilian government
deciding in favor of market expansion of Meta in Brazil. In 2016,
regarding the company's practice of paying local telcos for keeping its
apps out of the mobile internet data transfer limits, a deleterious
practice that is used to this day known as
[zero rating](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcJ7RnbMjE8),
the telco regulator Anatel decided in favor of zero rating, suggesting
that the practice could be even beneficial:

> As set forth by the analysis, in addition to the efficiency gains that
> I have just demonstrated, it's perceivable that the practice of
> different prices, hereby charged by Ministério Público Federal (federal
> public prosecutor office) at the CADE (Administrative Council of
> Economic Defense, responsible for antitrust enforcement), does not
> produce limiting effects to the innovation capacity and disruptive
> character of the content provision market and, for that reason, does
> not constitute barriers to entry therein.

This is despite the Brazilian internet law, Marco Civil da Internet,
explicitly mandating net neutrality in article 9:

> Art. 9 The party responsible for transmission, commutation or routing
> has the duty to deal in isonomic fashion any data packages, with no
> distinction made for content, origin and destination, service, terminal
> or application.

[Marco Civil da Internet](http://www.planalto.gov.br/ccivil_03/_ato2011-2014/2014/lei/l12965.htm#art9)

The decision was also rubber stamped by CADE, which decided in 2018 that
zero rating did not constitute an anti-competitive practice and did not
violate anti-trust laws.

We all know the result: WhatsApp became even more dominant than before in
Brazil in the following years, with no other messaging up even getting
close to WhatsApp's share in quantity of users. The massive disinformation
campaigns waged in WhatsApp in the same year,
[according to Yasodara Cordova](https://theintercept.com/2018/08/10/whatsapp-facebook-gratis-fake-news/),
then a researcher at the Berkman Klein Center for Internet & Society at
Harvard University, did heavily influence elections that year.

## Future of Whatsapp users' data sharing

According to IDEC, the case is still pending at the Brazilian data
protection authority, ANPD, which recently gained independence,
[gaining the legal status of an autarchy](https://www.in.gov.br/en/web/dou/-/medida-provisoria-n-1.124-de-13-de-junho-de-2022-407804608).

However, today's decision is certainly a win for meta, and a loss for
the privacy of millions of Brazilians.

Meanwhile, people can always use more privacy respecting messengers like
[Signal](https://signal.org/) or [Element](https://element.io/). The
trouble is getting their contacts to use the same app, as most people
tend to resist using anything different to what they are used to –
notwithstanding the matter that that acquaintance was forced upon them by
a giant company using shady business tactics.

I hate reading privacy policies as much as anyone else. That's why I
[recommend]({{ reference_post.url | relative_url }}) everyone to check
and see if a privacy policy has already been evaluated by ToS;DR before they sign
in to, or continue using, any service. And to contribute an evaluation
if it has not.
