  As the pandemic hit the world, many online communities have since
  started or moved to Discord. But the devil is in the details, or in
  the small print, as ToS;DR rates Discord's Terms of Service with grade
  E and we take a look at the reasons for that. Thankfully, there are
  alternatives with better conditions.

For over a year we have been living in a pandemic. Those of us that can,
do avoid leaving home as much as possible. The ensuing feeling of
isolation and need to connect to others has driven us to use online
services more and more, which has led applications like Zoom and Google
Meet to experience a staggering amount of growth.

The same has also happened to group chat with audio/video applications
like Discord. Everyone and their neighbor has been either creating a new
online community on Discord (oddly called "servers", even though they
are not servers in a strictly technical sense (internally they're called
"guilds", according to
[this Reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/discordapp/comments/fksh1b/since_when_did_discord_disband_the_word_guild_in/fkv1bfk/?context=1000))),
or moving to Discord their online community that existed some place
else.

It's safe to assume that, sadly, very few people do actually read
[Discord's terms of service](https://discord.com/terms) and
[privacy policy](https://discord.com/privacy). According to online reading
time estimators, to read both documents completely one would take almost
an hour. Of course, that would hold true for most online services
today on the internet. After all, who has the time nowadays to sit
through the hour or more of boring legalese that comprises most
companies' terms of service and privacy policies? If, like most people,
you haven't read them, you think that there's probably some nasty stuff
there, but users have no bargaining power when the alternative to
accepting it is getting no service at all. Or do they?

## Terms of Service, Didn't Read

Thankfully, a project named [ToS;DR](https://tosdr.org/), or Terms of
Service, Didn't Read (a play on the common internet slang TL;DR – too
long, didn't read) aims to change that. There you can find out quickly
how much nasty stuff (or perhaps, with some luck, maybe some good stuff)
is buried within those walls of text.

ToS;DR [started in 2012](https://tosdr.org/en/about), based on an idea
originated in the 2011 Chaos Communication Camp in Germany and the
[Unhosted](http://unhosted.org/) movement. The project is funded by
non-profits and also counts with the work of volunteers. It's also
[open source](https://github.com/tosdr/). You can contribute
[financially](https://opencollective.com/tosdr), by
[collecting and reviewing documents](https://edit.tosdr.org/), or
[with code](https://github.com/tosdr/edit.tosdr.org/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).

The quickest way you can have a look at how much user friendly a
service's terms and conditions are is by glancing at the ToS;DR grade
for that service. ToS;DR also has
[browser extensions](https://tosdr.org/en/downloads) that will show you
the grade for any website you're visiting, if they have already been
evaluated. The [DuckDuckGo search engine](https://duckduckgo.com) also
uses ToS;DR ratings on its Privacy Essentials browser extension for the
desktop and Privacy Browser for mobile.

If you want to delve into the details of the review of the terms of
service, see the reason for the attributed grade, or have a summary of
the main issues with them, you can look at the full list by clicking
the "view all points on Phoenix" button. Let's see an example with
[Discord's ToS;DR evaluation](https://tosdr.org/en/service/536). Every
point they make is linked to and quotes a specific excerpt of text from
the services' legal document.

## How good (or bad) are Discord's ToS and privacy policy?

Discord gets a grade E on ToS;DR. That is the lowest possible grade and,
for comparison, it is the same grade assigned to Facebook. But why?

<figure markdown="1" class="centered">

<figcaption>Discord currently gets Grade E in ToS;DR.</figcaption>
</figure>

Let's take a look at the good, the bad and the ugly as the reasons for
Discord receiving a grade E. As a disclaimer, I have been involved as
a volunteer including and rating other services in ToS;DR, but I have
absolutely no involvement with their rating of Discord.

### The good

The green lines on that page represent points present in the service's
legalese documents that are considered to be good for users.

Not everything is bad with Discord's conditions. There are some good
points. Most of them were likely put there to comply with European
[GDPR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Data_Protection_Regulation):
* [you can request access to your personal data](https://edit.tosdr.org//points/11466),
* [they may get your consent before they transfer you data to third parties](https://edit.tosdr.org//points/11459),
and
* [there is a complaint mechanism for handling of personal data](https://edit.tosdr.org//points/11467).

Others are good practices that more companies should adopt.
[The service will disclose users' information only under limited conditions](https://edit.tosdr.org//points/11460),
and if some company sends a copyright take down notice to remove content you
posted, the service
[offers you the opportunity to defend yourself](https://edit.tosdr.org//points/11430).

Discord
[promises not to sell your personal data](https://edit.tosdr.org/points/11458),
and [you can leave it at any time](https://edit.tosdr.org/points/11431).

If the terms of service are going to change, Discord promises to notice
users at least
[seven days in advance](https://edit.tosdr.org//points/9715).
That's good to know. Some other companies are in the bad habit of
changing their terms of service and privacy policy without notice to the
users and making it effective immediately. Who checks every day the ToS
and Privacy Policy of every service they have ever registered to and
compare to see if anything changed? Nobody does that, of course. Except
the ToS;DR bots: they do exactly that for you. So that's good to know.

Sadly, for some reason Discord decides that the same **does not apply**
to its privacy policy, which can change at any time, without prior
notice. I cannot imagine what strange reason they might have to have
completely different update policies for both documents, but they get
[a bad point](https://edit.tosdr.org/points/6117) for this.

### The bad

There is plenty to dislike here. Some have to do with content moderation,
which is never transparent on the reasons (or rather, lack of reasons)
for arbitrarily [removing](https://edit.tosdr.org/points/10890)
[access](https://edit.tosdr.org/points/9700) or content.

Many relate to user tracking, advertising and
[licensing content to third parties](https://edit.tosdr.org/points/11418).
Still others appear intent on limiting the ability of users to access
the judicial system for disputes if they need it, such as
[waiving the right to a class action](https://edit.tosdr.org/points/11445)
and
[subjecting to forced binding arbitration](https://edit.tosdr.org/points/11441).

The list is very long and I advise you to look it up yourself – it's
still a much shorter and more concise summary of the companies' original
documents they review.

### The ugly

The worst of the clauses, called "blocker" cases by ToS;DR, are marked in
red. The service gets a few of those.

Discord collects your private messages, images and voice conversations,
with a remark that the latter of those is only used to enable
communication delivery, as described in their
[privacy policy](https://discord.com/privacy):

> Information we collect may include but not be limited to username,
> email address, and any messages, images, transient VOIP data (to
> enable communication delivery only) or other content you send via the
> chat feature.

However, later in the privacy policy, in the section on "our use of your
information", they say they can use this information for marketing
communications as well as send it to third parties for advertisement
purposes, but at least you can
[opt](https://edit.tosdr.org/points/11453)-[out](https://edit.tosdr.org/points/11457)
of both, which warrants "good" points in ToS;DR.

For some reason, that paragraph above warranted the "service can read
your private messages" case in ToS;DR, which is a "blocker". Perhaps
because it's not clear in the privacy policy what they do with those
private messages and it's perfectly reasonable to assume that the
clauses about third party advertisement and marketing communications do
include that information.

[Waiving your moral rights](https://edit.tosdr.org/points/11423) over
any feedback given is also a "blocker" point, and it's not even legal to
do so under some jurisdictions.

Another ["blocker" point](https://edit.tosdr.org/points/11419) comes
from the following excerpt from the ToS:

>  The Company reserves the right to remove and permanently delete Your
>  Content from the Service with or without notice for any reason or no
>  reason.

It also states that your account can be deleted without a reason at any
time, although that warrants only
[a "bad"](https://edit.tosdr.org/points/9700), not "blocker" point in
ToS;DR.

> The Company may terminate your Account and your access to the Service
> (or, at the Company's sole option, applicable portions of the Service)
> at any time and for any reason. The Company is not required to provide
> you with any notice or warning prior to any such termination. 

{% assign linked_post=site.posts | where:"ref", "2020-12-09-why-do-we-still-call-facebook-a-platform-what-is-a-platform-really" | where:"lang", page.lang %}

Unfortunately, it's too common to see such clauses in companies' ToS.
While it's understandable from a business perspective that a company
offering a service would want to reserve the right to remove any content
at any time, this is not what users might want, like or expect. As
public discourse moves more and more to the online realm, and the tech
monopolies concentrate control over those
[platforms]({{linked_post.first.url}})
(consider that not long ago Discord was rumored to be in negotiations to
be acquired by Microsoft for $ 10 billion, but
[later turned it down to pursue its own IPO](https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/20/discord-ipo-microsoft-deal/)),
the place of discourse shifts from the private to the public realm, with
all the implications that comes with it. Content moderation becomes an
increasingly difficult challenge, as in some cases it may not be always
obvious to determine whether some speech is lawful free speech or should
be removed.

That is an ongoing debate involving researchers, internet specialists,
activists, politicians and others around the world as people ask for
scrutiny and transparency on the policies and reasons behind moderating
decisions, blocking and removing content. Who hasn't heard of a friend
or acquaintance that has lost access to years of data they gathered in a
service when a faceless, giant company decided to block them, citing
generic "terms of service violations" as the reason, without pointing
which specific action they did warranted the punishment, or which
specific clause was violated?

### Terms of service grade

Besides the aforementioned good, bad and blocker points, some aspects
that are also important in the terms of service and privacy policies,
but don't warrant either gaining or losing points for the grade system
are considered to be "neutral points". Even though they don't influence
the final grade, you are advised to read them too, as they all affect
your relationship with the service provider.

In the end, the service grade is calculated by weighing and summing all
of the points registered for all of its documents (usually the terms of
service and privacy policy, but some services have more complicated
arrangements). For instance, some bad cases are considered more severe
than others, so they subtract more points to the overall score.
Likewise, some good points are more important than others, so they add
more points. The grade rating system is described
[here](https://tosdr.org/en/classification).

In the end, Discord gets a **grade E**, which means that

> the terms of service raise very serious concerns. 

## Competitors with better ToS

Now that we have figured out the reasons why Discord's conditions for
offering the service "for free" are not really so good, we can ask
ourselves what alternatives are out there and if any of them have better
terms of service and privacy policies. As it turns out, yes, and here
are some of those. We also look at the features they offer, so you can
compare them and not lose much when you leave Discord (or never enter
it in the first place).

### Matrix

[Matrix](https://matrix.org/) is not really a service, but rather an
open, secure and distributed protocol for interoperable communication
services. In the tech monopoly's communication services you depend on a
single company making moderating decisions and not allowing you to
communicate with users outside their walled garden. With Matrix,
instead, you get to choose your own provider or even run one yourself,
while still being able to communicate with everyone in the Matrix
network. Think of it like email, but with end-to-end encryption, easy
to use interfaces, voice and video communication and much more. Please
see [Matrix's own website](https://matrix.org/docs/guides/introduction)
for a complete overview of its features.

Even better is the fact that you can start slowly migrating, or even
experimenting, your community to Matrix. One of its features is
[bridges](https://matrix.org/bridges/) that will sync your conversation
with many other messaging services, including Discord, mirroring the
channels. That way, people on Matrix can communicate with your community
on the other service back and forth, as if they were using the same
service. It's the kind of interoperability the big companies don't want
you to have.

To use Matrix you will need to use a
[Matrix client](https://matrix.org/clients/) (think of it as an app that
gives you access to the network). The leading free and open source
Matrix protocol client is [Element](https://element.io/). One company
offering a messaging service using Element is New Vector Ltd. So let's
take a look at their terms of service.

<figure markdown="1" class="centered">
![A screenshot of ToS;DR's grade for Element.]({{ 'assets/images/2021/08/tosdr-element-grade-en.gif' | relative_url }})
<figcaption>Element gets a much better Grade B in ToS;DR.</figcaption>
</figure>

There are a few points that may cause concern, but they do not seem so
serious in comparison to Discord's. Element gets a Grade B, which means
that

> the terms of services are fair towards the user but they could be
> improved. 

With that in consideration, creating a mirror of your Discord community
in Matrix and bridging the services seems to be a good idea for any
community.

### Slack

Another popular message channel service that many people use for
community building is Slack. Unlike Element, which is free and open
source software, Slack is proprietary. That means that it might be
bought by Big Tech in the future, with everything that it entails.
Slack also lacks functionality offered by Discord and Element like voice
and video calls.

On the other hand, Slack offers APIs for integration with many other
services and that is one reason for it to be still popular.

Also their terms of service are better rated than Discord's
and receive the same grade as Element's.

<figure markdown="1" class="centered">
![A screenshot of ToS;DR's terms of service grade for Slack.]({{ 'assets/images/2021/08/tosdr-slack-grade-en.gif' | relative_url }})
<figcaption>Slack also gets Grade B in ToS;DR.</figcaption>
</figure>

### Other services

For comparing other services, feel free to look them up on ToS;DR. If
you can't find a service, please
[make a new service request](https://tosdr.org/en/new_service) and it
will be eventually reviewed and added by the ToS;DR staff of volunteers.

## Conclusion

If, like most people, you never pay attention to terms of service and privacy
policies that you click to accept, you now have a tool at your disposal to be
able to look at a glance and see how good or bad a company promises to treat
you and your data.

Besides ToS;DR, there are also other sources that provide curated lists
that can help you discover and choose services that respect you and your
privacy. A couple of sites I like to use are
[privacytools.io](https://www.privacytools.io/) and
[switching.software](https://switching.software/).

Discord has terms of service and privacy policies that, according to
ToS;DR, are pretty much unfavorable to the user. Fortunately it is
relatively easy and painless to switch to Element, and even keep the
possibility to communicate with people who haven't yet decided to leave
Discord.
