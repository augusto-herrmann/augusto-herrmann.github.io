What is the current state of open data around the world? Is open data facing
an identity crisis? These are some of the questions that a recent book and its
launch event tried to answer.

Six months ago, a book contemplating the state of open data around the
world was released by the
[Open Data for Development (OD4D)](https://www.od4d.net/) initiative. The OD4D
[is](https://www.od4d.net/about.html)

> a global partnership that supports southern leadership and locally-led data
> ecosystems around the world as a way to spur positive social change and
> sustainable development – **OD4D's website**

The program is hosted by the International Development Research Centre (IDRC)
of Canada. The IDRC has also published the book, in partnership with
[African Minds](http://africanminds.co.za/), a non-profit, open access book
publisher. As an open access book,
[State of Open Data: Histories and Horizons](https://stateofopendata.od4d.net/) is available for free reading online.

To accompany the launch of the book, the World Bank has hosted an event, both
local and online, so that people could ask Tim Davis, who is one of the
editors of the book, and Anat Lewin, a Senior ICT Policy Specialist at the
World Bank, for questions related to the book and the topics it covers. Named
“[Let's Talk Data: Does Open Data Have an Identity Crisis?](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/book-launch-at-world-bankthe-state-of-open-data-histories-and-horizons-tickets-61431189341)”,
it took place on May 20th, 2019, and I had the opportunity to watch, take notes
and ask some questions.

## Privacy and personal data challenges in an open data context

Tim got through each chapter of the book in reverse order. He highlighted the
need to face the challenge of dealing with privacy and personal data without
reinforcing the old practices of holding on to data under a power and fear
rationale.

</figure>

I can say that this challenge is not new, but it is aggravated as
governments and companies alike are collecting more and more personal
information on citizens around the clock. While some cases are pretty
clear-cut, other times it can be indeed difficult to weigh the scale in favor
of either the personal privacy of people that some kind of relationship with
the state, such as receiving public funds in some way, or the need for
disclosure and transparency to the public to hold them accountable. Sometimes,
different societies will weigh those needs differently and arrive at different
outcomes.

A recent example of one of these differences is the decision of an EU court to
[keep secret €4,416-a-month worth of expenses](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/sep/25/mep-expenses-eu-court-ruling)
of public money spent by the MEPs. On the other hand, similar
expenses from the Brazilian Chamber of Deputies are released as
[open data](https://www.camara.leg.br/cota-parlamentar/) (and also
[its Senate counterpart](https://www12.senado.leg.br/transparencia/dados-abertos-transparencia/dados-abertos-ceaps)).
In fact, for a few years there has been a
crowdfunded, open source project to track these expenses and find possible
discrepancies by using a network of dedicated activists and artificial
intelligence tools. Project *[Serenata de Amor](https://serenata.ai/)* has
received accolades of the press and even has received
[attention from the World Bank](https://blogs.worldbank.org/governance/rosie-robot-social-accountability-one-tweet-time),
in the form of an article written by two of the founders of the project,
Yasodara Córdova and Eduardo Cuducos, displayed as an example of good
governance for development.

The reasonable middle ground seems to be to disclose as open data the
information related to expenditures of public money, such as
[the wages of public officials](http://dados.gov.br/dataset/carreiras-do-poder-executivo-federal),
or the list of
[beneficiaries of the *Bolsa Família* social program and the stipends received](http://dados.gov.br/dataset/bolsa-familia-pagamentos),
but not other personal information about them that is completely unrelated to
the expenditure of public funds, such as their home addresses or medical
records. That has been the stance that has prevailed in Brazil, while so many
other countries
[have been lagging behind in the transparency of public expenditure](https://index.okfn.org/dataset/spending/).

Speaking of fiscal transparency, Tim Davies mentioned his work on the
[Fiscal Data Package](http://www.fiscaltransparency.net/ofdp/), which is a
data standard for improved reusability and interoperability for budget and
spending data that has been increasingly adopted by countries.

As for the excuses to not open data under power and fear rationales, most of
those have been represented pretty early on the
[Open Data Excuses Bingo](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nDtHpnIDTY_G32EMJniXaOGBufjHCCk4VC9WGOf7jK4/edit#),
along with the argumentation on why the excuse is unfounded or in which ways
it could be addressed. This OD Bingo has since been translated to
[Italian](https://github.com/gbonanome/opendatabingo) and
[Portuguese](https://campagnucci.github.io/opendatabingo/), brought to my
attention by Fernanda Campagnucci on
[episode 17 of the *Pizza de Dados* podcast](https://www.podbean.com/site/EpisodeDownload/PBA7F40D8XQY9).

Still on the topic of privacy, Anat Lewin made a very pertinent remark
that aggregated data that you would normally not think of privacy issues
become so depending on the sample size of the dataset, as having fewer samples
in an aggregated cross-section of a dataset could more easily lead
to re-identification of individuals.


## Organizational and governance challenges

Some topics commented by Anat Lewin in the event were related to
organizational and governance challenges faced by governments when
implementing open data:

* open data policy needs to be a whole-of-government approach, and not isolated silos
* people need to work with open data as a part of their expected job, not an additional
thing on top of the regular job
* capacity building for both the supply side and demand side of data
* data literacy needs to be part of the mainline education program

I agree with all of those points, so let's unwrap those one at a time. First,
experience has shown us that isolated open data initiatives in public
administration do not last for long and die when the people sponsoring them
leave the administration. So yes, it has to be a whole-of-government directive,
sponsored by top-level stakeholders, in order to be given enough priority, to
set procedures, norms and responsibilities in place that will make the
initiative persist in time. But, as we learned during a series of international
workshops on open data planning organized by the
[Public Administration Division](https://publicadministration.un.org/en/) of
the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs in
[2016](https://publicadministration.un.org/en/news-and-events/calendar/ModuleID/1146/ItemID/2923/mctl/EventDetails)
and
[2017](https://publicadministration.un.org/en/news-and-events/calendar/ModuleID/1146/ItemID/2942/mctl/EventDetails),
the procedures, norms and responsibilities need to
be reach out to the leaves of the organizational tree, especially in large
countries, for it to reach relevant data subjects that are under the
responsibilities of different government institutions. The lessons learned are
[summarized in a Guide to Open Data Planning for Sustainable Development](http://dados.gov.br/noticia/onu-lanca-guia-de-planejamento-de-dados-abertos-governamentais).

<figure markdown="1">
![Questions: What are the key lessons learned? Is there any room for improvement? Based on the questions, participants shared the following lessons: - Policy and regulation should ask for OGD action plans at the agency level, which need to be accompanied with education material - There is a need to understand what has to be centralized and decentralized, based on the national OGD needs and maturity status - In all OGD initiatives, there is a need to consider the entire data life cycle - Coordination is required from the very beginning with those who need and use the data - Open data by default may not be the best approach; close collaboration with the user community to prioritize data is required instead - Institutionalization of OGD initiative and governance structure - Audit processes can push for open data, and accountability practices require evidence data - There is always a need for champions inside and outside the government -   some pushing for opening the data and others using that data]({{ 'assets/images/2019/11/ogd-international-workshop-2017-report.gif' | relative_url }})
<figcaption>Summary of the key lessons learned, contained in the report.</figcaption>

The need for clearly defined responsibilities and roles in the data opening
pipeline is also very much in line with Anat's second observation, noting that
people need to produce open data as part of their expected job.

Also, none of the advances that we achieved in Brazil in those years would
have been possible without the extensive
[capacity building](http://wiki.dados.gov.br/Capacitacao-da-INDA.ashx)
program we implemented, training over 700 public servants, in person, on
[how to build open data plans](http://wiki.dados.gov.br/Capacitacao-para-Elaboracao-de-Planos-de-Dados-Abertos.ashx),
and almost two thousand people through the online course. What we did on
the supply side of open data was complemented by the
[local chapter of the W3C](http://www.w3c.br/GT/GrupoDadosAbertos)
in the form of guides and online courses on using open data.

<figure markdown="1" class="text-wide">
![one of the training sessions for public servants on how to plan for open data]({{ 'assets/images/2019/11/open-data-planning-traning.jpg' | relative_url }})
<figcaption>One of the workshops on open data planning for public servants in the Brazilian federal government.</figcaption>
</figure>

In recent years, in the wake of the perceived need for more data scientists,
data engineers and related data professionals in almost every field, I believe
that many online courses and other resources have, in a way, catered to the
need for more training in data literacy. However, data usage skills are surely
not yet widespread enough to consider that open data is something usable by
everybody. But will that ever be the case? That is something to think about.

Eight years ago, Tom Steinberg, founder of My Society, wrote
[an article on his personal blog](https://steiny.typepad.com/premise/2011/04/asking-the-wrong-question-about-datagov.html),
commented on [by The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/blog/2011/apr/05/data-gov-steinberg-questions)
stating clearly that open data isn't, at least directly, for everybody, but
for people with the required skills. It seems obvious, though, that
nevertheless the general public can benefit from open data, even if they
can't use it directly. That is a topic worth revisiting in a future discussion.
Considering that now that an increasing number of people are acquiring data
skills, will open data ever be accessible to a wide audience?

On the topic of data use by society for civic purposes, someone from the
audience questioned, in the context of government accountability, whether or
not the theory of citizen “armchair auditors” would ever be viable. Tim's
answer was that the “armchair auditor” is possible in a long tail form.
Whenever people get frustrated enough with government they will dive into the
data to find out information to hold them accountable.


## Outlier leaders, Latin America and the challenges of measuring open data impact

The book offers, at the same time, a broad overview of the state of open data
in the world, while also going pretty in-depth on several key issues involving
the open data landscape. It covers how open data fares in specific sectors,
such as government finances, agriculture, education, national statistics, etc.
It also deals with current issues related to open data such as data literacy,
data infrastructure, algorithms, artificial intelligence and privacy.
Additionally, the roles of key stakeholders in the open data ecosystem, such as
governments, civil society, private sector, academia and journalism. There is
also an overview of each region of the world on Section 4.

<figcaption>The table of contents for Section 4.</figcaption>
</figure>

Here we take a look at Latin America and the Caribbean. The authors of this
chapter are Silvana Fumega, Research and Policy Director of the
[Latin America Initiative for Open Data](https://idatosabiertos.org/) (ILDA),
and Maurice McNaughton, Director at the Mona School of Business & Management,
at the University of the West Indies.

There, the authors highlight the growth of the open data movement and
strong civil society networks. Regional events, such as *Desarrollando America
Latina* and [Condatos](http://condatos.org/) –
[Abrelatam](https://abrelatam.org), have been instrumental in shaping open data
progress in Latin America. Condatos congregates participants from governments
in the region, while its sister event Abrelatam, focuses on discussions on open
data by the region's civil society organizations.
On the other hand, countries that do not share a language in the
region, such as Brazil, have been more regularly engaged with the international
open data community instead, taking part in global events such as the
International Open Data Conference, in lieu of being more integrated with their
regional peers.

Another key finding in the region has been that, while participation and
engagement by civil society organizations in the region has been strong,
the private sector has been slow in adopting the use of open data for its
own benefit.

> Although there is a recognition that private sector companies using open data
> need to be included in regional discussions and activities, substantial
> efforts to make this happen have not yet materialised. There are several
> businesses working with open data and civic technology in the region, but
> only a small number work with civil society and governmental actors in the
> open data community, with firms such as Properati, Junar, and Dymaxion Labs
> acting as the exception rather than the rule. – **State of Open Data,
> Chapter 4**

In part this could be attributed to a lack of awareness by companies of the
opportunities to use open government data as an asset in their own business
analytics and machine learning activities to gain better insight, find more
prospective clients for their products and services, cut operational costs
by increasing efficiency in production and logistics, and also innovate in
new data-driven business. It is well known that companies have been
struggling to find enough qualified professionals with data science, data
engineering and related backgrounds.

> – **Augusto Herrmann**

Even in those circles, people often struggle to find the data they need, even
as they take the pragmatic (and legally dangerous) stance of just finding
some data to use and do not care about the licensing details and its
implications, being focused instead in the immediate need of achieving some
analysis or integration with said data that will bring results to the core
business, without caring to the legal consequences of, e.g., unauthorized use.
Sometimes people do care if open data is easy to find and to use, but are not
aware of the decade long struggle and activism for open data, and do not call
open data by its name, naming it just “data”. That is something I often see in
message groups related to the data science community in Brazil. Perhaps this
is the real “identity crisis” of open data around the world: the need to
clearly acknowledge and raising awareness that in order to enable many emerging
activities today such as data science, AI modelling and training, and smart
human cities we need not just data, but *open* data.

On the other hand, another factor could be influencing the lack of documented
cases of open data impact around the world. There are so few obstacles to
using open government data, as it is freely available to everyone, that
sometimes companies do use the data but refrain from telling the outside
world the fact that they are using it. The rationale is that, if they were to
disclose their use of open data, they would alert the competition to make the
same use of data, and then lose a competitive edge. I have been arguing
about this possibility for a while now in my talks about the open data ecosystem.
Judging from a comment Tim Davies made during his talk, he seems to agree
with that point, emphasising how the low barrier to entry for using open data
is.

Another piece of evidence that companies using open data do not want to
attract attention to themselves for doing it is that efforts to openly map
such use cases, either by using web based surveys or detailed case studies,
often do not get a lot of respondents. For example, the
[Open Data's Impact Report](http://odimpact.org/), an in-depth analysis on
the impact of open data around the world by evaluating case studies led
by the [GovLab](http://thegovlab.org/) of the New York University Tandon
School of Engineering, features only 4 cases of open data impact in Latin
America.

We can see a similar picture when we look at another survey that
is more broad, open for anyone to submit use cases. The
[Open Data Impact Map](https://opendataimpactmap.org/) is also funded by the
IDRC and the World Bank, but also has dozens of regional supporters. In the
[regional report section](https://opendataimpactmap.org/lac), we can see that,
excluding Mexico, there were only 72 cases of open data impact in Latin
America. The reason not to count Mexico is that it is a clear outlier in
Latin America, accounting alone for 95 impact cases, which is more than all
other countries in the region combined.

<figcaption>Number of cases of open data impact in Latin America and Caribbean by country.</figcaption>
</figure>

Actually, this is a trend that can be observed in other regions of the world
as well: an outlier has a disproportionately high number of open data impact
cases while every other country in the region has a lot less documented cases.
Besides Mexico in Latin America & Caribbean, there is the UK in Europe and
Central Asia, the United States in North America and India in South Asia
(those are some of the regional partitions of the world used in that study).

## Final thoughts

All things considered, the State of Open Data book is worth a read for
anyone concerned with open data around the world, while it's still up to
date. Make sure to check it out.

As for the supposed identity crisis of open data, do open data policies
need a rebranding? Will open data ever reach a broader awareness in society?
When even people that do need and use data every day are often not familiar
with the basic concepts of openness, these are some of the emerging questions
we are left with to ponder.
