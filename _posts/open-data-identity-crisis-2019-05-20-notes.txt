20/05/2019 12:30 GMT-3

State of Open Data book released last Friday:
https://stateofopendata.od4d.net/

Tim Davies got through each chapter of the book in reverse order

Tim Davies:
* new challenges to deal with privacy and personal data without reinforcing the
  old practices of holding on to data under a power and fear rationale

Anat Lewin:
* open data policy needs to be a whole-of-government approach, and not isolated silos
* people need to work with open data as a part of their expected job, not an additional
thing on top of the regular job
* capacity building for both the supply side and demand side of data
* data literacy needs to be part of the mainline education program

Tim Davies:
* the open contracting data standard began at the World Bank, Tim Davies worked on it
* quantify the additional percentage you get when you are more open

Anat Lewin:
* data that you would normally not think of privacy issues become so depending of
  the sample size: e.g. hotel occupancy in small countries in the Caribbean

Question from the audience:
* citizen "armchair auditors" has been debunked (?)

Tim Davies:
* many business using open data don't like to reveal that they do because there
  is a lower barrier to entry
* the "armchair auditor" is possible in a long tail form. When people get
  frustrated enough with government they will dive into the data
