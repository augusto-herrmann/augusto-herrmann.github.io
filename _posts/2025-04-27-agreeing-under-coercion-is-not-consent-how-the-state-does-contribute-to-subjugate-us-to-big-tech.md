  We have become accustomed to accepting terms of service without reading,
  giving away our data and power to the few large companies that control the
  internet. The worst part is that state power, in some countries, especially
  Brazil, has contributed to worsening this situation by conditioning the
  exercise of duties and the realization of rights on the citizen's acceptance
  of the demands of the large platforms. Find out how we can resist and what
  we can do to try to reverse this situation.

For many years, people have been conditioned to check the box or click
the button, without reading, stating that they agree with the "terms of
service" and "privacy policy" of every online service they want to use,
without reflecting for a second on the consequences. The devil is in the
details, as many times, in the fine print, personal data usage practices
are hidden, which, if read, the person would probably not agree with. For
example, the sharing of personal data with partners for marketing
purposes and other unspecified purposes.

Most often the person does not have the option to disagree, for various
reasons. For example, due to social pressure, considering that their
entire social circle uses the same messaging app or social network. Or
even because the companies with which the person needs to interact only
use a certain messaging app, without which it becomes impossible to buy
a good or service. In these cases, the person may try to look for a
competitor that uses a different app, but this is not always possible, as
most of the time all companies use the same app, always from the few
companies called "[Big Tech](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Tech)"
that hold a monopoly or oligopoly in the sector.

In the case of Brazil, for example, a de facto monopoly of WhatsApp has
been established, especially since the company Meta, owner of the app,
began paying mobile internet operators for the privilege of excluding
only its apps from the mobile internet plan artificial data rate
limitations, to the detriment of other apps. In Brazil, mobile internet
plans have data traffic volume limitations. If a person uses any other
messaging app, such as Signal or Element, they will quickly exhaust their
limit. On the other hand, if they use WhatsApp, they won't spend
anything. It is exactly this market imbalance that has led to the
dominance of this app in Brazil, where almost 100% of people use it.
This creates an expectation in social and commercial relationships that
everyone needs to use it.

This market distortion was evaluated between 2015 and 2018 by the
[Conselho Administrativo de Defesa Econômica – CADE](https://www.gov.br/cade/pt-br),
a government agency responsible for defending competition, which decided
to dismiss the case after receiving a response by 
[Anatel](https://www.gov.br/anatel/pt-br), the agency responsible for
telecommunications, with an argumentation contrary to any logic, that the
exemption from traffic limits for Meta would expand competition and
stimulate innovation. Ten years later, we know well what the result was.
This is a story that I shall tell in detail in another text. I will show
then who the parties involved were, the arguments and predictions they
made, and the contrast with what actually happened in the following
years. I have already told part of that story to Prof. Sérgio Amadeu in
[episode 92 of the Tecnopolítica podcast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcJ7RnbMjE8).
It is an undisputed fact that, in these years, the breadth of situations
that force us to accept against our will whatever "Big Tech" wants to
impose on us have increased exponentially.

The worst kind of trap, however, is when the State itself establishes
obligations or imposes conditions for the receipt of rights, unless the
citizen agrees to use a specific app or social network from the "*Big
Tech*". Today we live in the tragic situation where all government apps
are closed-source, meaning that the source code cannot be inspected to
verify what they are actually doing and what data they are collecting on
your device.
[Carteira de Identidade Nacional – CIN](https://www.gov.br/governodigital/pt-br/identidade/identificacao-do-cidadao-e-carteira-de-identidade-nacional),
[Carteira Digital de Trânsito – CDT](https://www.gov.br/pt-br/apps/carteira-digital-de-transito-1)
(formerly known as CNH Digital) and the
[e-Título](https://www.justicaeleitoral.jus.br/titulo-eleitoral/) are
just a few examples of government apps, produced using public resources
from the treasury, but whose source code is not accessible to the public
that funded their development. To learn more about why the public should
have the right to access and use the source code of the software they
paid for, check out the
[*Public Money, Public Code*](https://publiccode.eu/en/)
campaign by the
[*Free Software Foundation Europe* – FSFE](https://fsfe.org/index.en.html).
In contrast to Brazil, many government apps in European Union countries,
such as Germany, are open-source.

The lack of access to the source code is not the only problem with these
government apps. Perhaps even more serious is the fact that these apps
are only available in the proprietary stores of Google and Apple. In
addition to the issue of collecting data from all Brazilian citizens by
these foreign companies, which is in itself already serious, there are
also legal problems and a democratic problem. Legally, a contract cannot
be established under coercion or threat. Such a contract is not legally
enforceable. Furthermore, the fact that citizens cannot comment or
influence the terms of service and privacy policies becomes a democratic
problem, if everyone is forced by the State in some way or another to
accept them.

What the State is doing with this practice is privatizing the law in an
anti-democratic process. The citizen has to obey and has no participation
in defining the text that they are supposedly legally bound to. Who
determines what appears in these terms of service and privacy policies
are exclusively Alphabet, the owner of Google, and Apple. What they write
becomes effectively as if it were law, and there is nothing citizens can
do about it, as soon as the State conditions the fulfillment of duties
and access to rights to the acceptance of these terms. It is a tyranny of
the *Big Tech*, with the approval of the governments of countries that
adopt the practice of establishing closed-source apps in proprietary
stores of foreign oligopolies as the only means of exercising
citizenship.

In other times, tyranny would lead to popular revolt against the tyrant.
In the present case, this does not happen, in large part, because people
have been conditioned over the years by these companies in the Silicon
Valley oligopoly to accept without reading and paying attention to the
obligations and permissions "agreed" to in the terms of service. With
this, they have managed to create a sense of resignation, where people
think that everything is very bad, but believe that there is nothing
anyone can do about it.

This is not true. There is a lot that we can do. It's not easy, but there
are several attitudes that we can take. For starters, we can demand from
politicians and vote for those who commit to public policies that promote
the creation of a national digital infrastructure. For example, that they
defend the idea that if any software is developed with public resources, it
belongs to the public and should become free and open source software, as
advocated by the *Public Money, Public Code* campaign by the FSFE. We can
also demand that they value the protection of personal data and digital
sovereignty, promoting the development of a national digital
infrastructure, both in terms of hardware
([sovereign cloud](https://www.nexojornal.com.br/expresso/2024/10/09/o-que-e-nuvem-soberana-e-por-que-o-brasil-quer-ter-uma)),
and in terms of software.

In addition to this, it is necessary to develop and retain the talents
formed in Brazilian universities, so that technology professionals remain
in Brazil, instead of going to work for foreign companies, and so that
the country has control over the technology. To achieve this, it is
necessary for universities to have adequate funding for research and
education in the area of technology, in the opposite direction of the cuts
made in recent years in the name of fiscal adjustment. Creating tax
incentives for Brazilian companies in the sector to develop, compensating
for the fiscal effect with higher taxes for foreign companies that see
the country as digital colonies for data extraction.

On the other hand, beyond public policy issues, we can also take various
personal attitudes. Using free app stores, such as
[F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/) on Android-based mobile devices. Removing
proprietary apps that collect your data, including those that come
pre-installed on the system from the factory – the so-called
"[bloatware](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloatware)". There are guides
and tutorials on the internet that demonstrate step by step how to do
this. The [xdaforums.com](https://xdaforums.com/) forum usually has
personalized guides for each mobile device model.

Every time you sign up for a new service, carefully evaluate what
personal data is being requested. Like everyone else, I don't have time
to read in minute detail all the terms of service of all the platforms,
sites, services, and apps that I need to use. That's why it's important
to search for the name of the service, platform, or app on
[ToS;DR](https://tosdr.org), see its privacy rating, and the main
negative (or positive) points of the summary of its terms of service. To
understand what it is and how to use the tool, please read
[the text I wrote on the subject]({{ reference_post.url | relative_url }}).

In the social and commercial sphere, always prefer free apps for
messaging, map navigation, and other daily needs. Introduce the people
you know to the apps and solutions you use, so they can see that they not
only reduce our exposure to personal data and submission to foreign "*Big
Tech*" companies, but also that these solutions are viable, convenient,
and easy to use in daily life.
