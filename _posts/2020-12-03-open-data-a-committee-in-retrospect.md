  Last Thursday the Open Data Steering Committee met again, as it's about
  to be recommissioned after having been disbanded almost two years ago.
  What can we learn from reviewing its history?

The prospect of recreating an open data committee in the Brazilian federal
government prompted me to remember and tell the story of the open data
committee that we created eight years ago. Please note, however, that this
is not the whole story of the National Infrastructure for Open Data (INDA),
or even the most important parts of it, but rather just the part that
involves its committee and the issues that were discussed in it over the
years.

## Inspiration and motivation

Back in 2011, when we were designing the open data policy of the Brazilian
federal government, one of the challenges we faced was how to ensure that
citizens had a place and a say in how the policy would be run. A role model
for us was the
[Brazilian Internet Steering Committee](https://cgi.br/) (CGI.br).

Established in 1995, CGI.br has
[representatives from multiple sectors of society](https://cgi.br/about/):
government, companies, the third sector, the science and technology
community and an internet expert. While the government representatives are
chosen by direct appointment, the sectorial representatives are chosen
by vote from legal entities from each respective sector. The internet
expert is appointed by the Ministry of Science and Technology. These rules
are laid out in detail on
[Decree n. 4,829](http://www.planalto.gov.br/ccivil_03/decreto/2003/d4829.htm),
from 2003.

<figure markdown="1">
![Chart showing the composition of the membership in CGI.br: 9 from government, 4 from the private sector, 4 from the third sector, 3 from the science and technology community and one internet expert.]({{ 'assets/images/2020/12/cgi-membership.gif' | relative_url }})
<figcaption>Composition of the membership in CGI.br (adapted from <a target="_blank" href="https://cgi.br/membros/">CGI.br's website</a>).</figcaption>
</figure>

The CGI.br was chosen as a role model mostly because it is seen as a
successful example of multistakeholder good governance on technological
and societal issues, as had been the case for more than a decade by
then. In addition to that, the authorities at the then Secretariat for
Logistics and Information Technology (SLTI) already had direct
experience in participating on it, as SLTI had a seat on CGI.br, so it
was an easy idea to sell to senior staff as well.

However, because we had no budget at all dedicated the nascent open data
initiative, some compromises had to be made. The CGI.br has always been
well funded because part of the registration fees paid to .br TLD
domain name registrar by people and organizations that want to register
a domain name goes to fund the
[Brazilian Network Information Center](https://nic.br/about-nic-br/)
(NIC.br), which provides operational support for the CGI.br, as well as
other related operations, such as the
[registrar itself](http://registro.br/) (registro.br), the
[Regional Center for Studies on the Development of the Information Society](https://www.cetic.br/en/sobre/)
(CETIC.br)
and the [regional office of the W3C in Brazil](https://www.w3c.br/Sobre/)
(W3C.br).

We, on the other hand, had no such luck in securing funds for the
initiative. Also, we tried at the time to get the open data policy to be
instated by a decree like the CGI.br is, but the political force in
government of the open data movement was only enough to get an
[instruction norm](https://dados.gov.br/pagina/instrucao-normativa-da-inda).
That's why we had to simplify the governance structure a bit. The
[National Infrastructure for Open Data Steering Committee](https://wiki.dados.gov.br/Comite-Gestor-da-INDA.ashx)
(CGINDA) was established by *Instrução Normativa n. 4*, in 2012, with
representatives from nine government bodies, one representative from
civil society, which was to be appointed by the National Secretariat for
Social Articulation, and one from the academic sector, to be appointed
by the Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation (MCTI). That meant
there were no elections to be held to choose the representatives, which
is worse for participation when compared to CGI.br, but it also meant
that we wouldn't have to bear the cost of an election we couldn't
afford. It also meant that the committee could start working straight
away and get things working fast. The operational support for running
the committee would be offered by the SLTI, which would also lead it.

</figcaption>
</figure>

By then, the planning for the initiative was already being elaborated
collaboratively by interested civil servants and motivated people from
civil society, as can be seen registered on the
[planning workshop in March](https://wiki.dados.gov.br/I-Workshop-de-Planejamento-da-INDA.ashx)
and further open meetings held in
[April](https://wiki.dados.gov.br/Reuniao-de-Acompanhamento-do-Planejamento-da-INDA-em-19-04-2011.ashx),
[May](https://wiki.dados.gov.br/Verificacao-e-Aprovacao-do-Plano-de-Trabalho-da-INDA-2011-05-11.ashx)
and
[July](https://wiki.dados.gov.br/Reuniao-de-acompanhamento-do-plano-de-projeto-2011-07-12.ashx),
as well as the public hearing of instruction norm held in October, during
the 1st National Open Data Conference.
So it was only natural that the structure of the committee would have a
similar composition to the participation that had already been taking
place since the beginning of 2011.

</figure>

## First meetings

Although the CGINDA was first established in April 2012, the appointments of
representatives by ministries and public bodies took some time to happen.
Therefore, the
[first meeting](https://wiki.dados.gov.br/GetFile.aspx?File=%2fComiteGestor%2fAtas%2fAta%20da%201a%20reuni%c3%a3o%20do%20Comit%c3%aa%20Gestor%20da%20INDA%2001-10-12.odt)
took place only in October. As it was still a novelty for everyone
involved, the recent *Instrução Normativa n. 4* and details of the way
the CGINDA would be operated were explained there. The other major topic
was the first
[Open Data Action Plan](https://wiki.dados.gov.br/Plano-de-Acao-da-INDA.ashx),
which was based upon the experience of the plan originally built
collaboratively on the March 2011 workshop. There was a perceived
necessity both to discuss the action plan extensively and to get it out
quickly, so the next meeting was held in November, even though the
meetings of the committee were supposed to be bi-monthly. However, the
repeated requests for adjustments meant that the formal approval of the
plan by the CGINDA would only happen in February 2013. That
[Open Data Action Plan](https://wiki.dados.gov.br/Plano-de-Acao-da-INDA-2013-2014.ashx)
spanned the period 2013-2014.

This first phase of the committee was marked by discussions about how to
broaden civil society's participation in it. Professor Gisele Craveiro
from the University of São Paulo, the appointed representative from
civil society in the name of Open Knowledge Brazil, often brought to
light the necessity to stream the meetings on the internet, so that more
people could watch and participate. It may seem unusual for the time and
also today that discussions could happen in the open like this, but that
was what people expected of us. We had just finished building Brazil's
national open data portal
[in a totally open and participatory manner](https://blog.okfn.org/2012/05/10/new-brazilian-portal-dados-gov-br-made-by-citizens/),
unlike anything that had been done around the world before. Hence, ways
to improve society's participation was one of the issues being discussed
concerning
[CGINDA's own bylaw](https://wiki.dados.gov.br/GetFile.aspx?File=%2fComiteGestor%2fResolu%c3%a7%c3%b5es%2fresolucao-cginda-1-24-3-2017%2cpdf.pdf),
which would end up being finished and formally approved by the committee
only in 2017.

Also discussed in many meetings at that time was the monitoring and the
carrying out of the then current Open Data Action Plan and also the
parts of Brazil's Open Government Action Plan that concerned open data.
Brazil had been one of the founders of the
[Open Government Partnership](https://www.opengovpartnership.org/) in 2011
and from the beginning all action plans have always featured commitments
related to open data.

## Getting up to full speed ahead

CGINDA's meeting in November 2013 started a new phase in the committee. The
MCTI, which had so far not participated at all, nor appointed the academic
sector representative, began attending regularly. Many relevant topics were
discussed then in the committee:
* the upcoming
  [2nd National Open Data Conference](https://wiki.dados.gov.br/II-Encontro-Nacional-de-Dados-Abertos.ashx)
  and the open data hackathon that happened during it;
* how to handle the heterogenous open data licenses of open data already
  present in the open data portal (which warranted later a
  [study on the issue](https://wiki.dados.gov.br/Produto-GT1-Levantamento-Juridico-Licenciamento-Dados-Abertos.ashx));
* a possible network with support from W3C.br, to build capacity around
  open data (which sadly never came to pass as a network, even though we
  [did offer courses to thousands of people](https://wiki.dados.gov.br/Capacitacao-da-INDA.ashx)
  in public administration on subjects related to open data over the years,
  in partnership with Enap, the public administration school);

and more.

<figure markdown="1">
[![Vagner Diniz, Valter Correia and Míriam Chaves present to a full house at the event at the auditorium of the Minsitry of Planning]({{ 'assets/images/2020/12/gestao-em-destaque-dados-abertos-2013.jpg' | relative_url }})](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3CeB1HFq0U)
<figcaption>Then current developments of the open data policy were presented

</figure>

The Second National Open Data Conference, which received almost 300
attendees in the span of two days in November 2013, was very important
and highly influential in the history of open data in Brazil. Nearly
every speaker at the conference would later take an even more important
role in some way in developing the open data ecosystem in the years to
come. There were not only talks, but also courses, workshops on topics
very much relevant to the open data agenda and an open data contest that
awarded applications that used open data for developing civic
applications.

The themes of the workshops were:

* economic sustainability of open data;
* local case studies of open data in states and municipalities;
* education and open data;
* privacy and personal data protection;
* open data licensing.

<a target="_blank" href="https://wiki.dados.gov.br/II-Encontro-Nacional-de-Dados-Abertos.ashx">
Second National Open Data Conference</a>, in Brasília, in November 2013.</figcaption>
</figure>

After some exposition by experts on each subject matter, workshop
attendees were invited to discuss, collaborate and build a proposal to
adjust the course of the open data policy. Those proposals were then
brought before the next
[meeting of the CGINDA in January 2014](https://wiki.dados.gov.br/GetFile.aspx?File=%2fComiteGestor%2fAtas%2fAta%20da%208a%20reuniao%20ordinaria%20do%20Comite%20Gestor%20da%20INDA%202014-01-22.odt).
This was one more way to try to further social participation in the open
data initiative.

## Preparations for growth

Also in 2014 came the first proof of concept of an institution-wide Open
Data Plan, shown at the CGINDA. It proposed a set of commitments that
the Ministry of Planning, Budget and Management would assume to open up
certain datasets, up to a specific deadline and an indication of who
would be responsible for it. That kind of plan would later become
instrumental in expanding the open data policy to all government bodies.
At that time, the most common outcome was that some institutions with
engaged individuals were ahead of the curve publishing some open data,
while other institutions were lying still. So an instrument to make the
publishing of new open data a regular and organized process was sorely
needed.

By the end of the year 2014 and throughout 2015, progress had become slow.
Despite all the advances in years prior, relatively few institutions did
engage in active publication of data in the open data portal. All of it
depended upon the existence of a few key influential stakeholders in each
government institution to be convinced and engaged on it, as there was
not much else to push these institutions forward. Despite the Access to
Information Law, enacted in 2011, demanding in Article 8 that
information be made available as open data, it would seldom become practice.
At that time, the management of the initiative had become severely
understaffed as well, at times manned by a single person (myself). That
was also when the open data policy became the object of an
[audit from the Federal Court of Accounts](https://www.lexml.gov.br/urn/urn:lex:br:tribunal.contas.uniao;plenario:acordao:2016-11-16;2904)
(TCU).

Another problem was that some major data
repositories from key institutions were still not integrated to the
national open data portal, such as the
[National Infrastructure for Spatial Data](https://www.inde.gov.br/) (INDE).
The technical challenge of automatically making available those spatial
datasets on the open data portal was implemented in this period.

That time was also useful to evaluate and monitor the implementation of
the ongoing open data plan of the Ministry of Planning. The plan would
become a model for other government bodies to make their own
institution-wide plan, as the Ministry of Justice would soon follow up
by issuing its own open data plan.

It was also in that period that we started issuing annual reports on the
progress of the open data policy. The
[2014](https://wiki.dados.gov.br/Balanco-da-INDA-em-2014.ashx) and
[2015](https://wiki.dados.gov.br/Balanco-da-INDA-em-2015.ashx) reports
were quite simple, but they became more elaborate and detailed over the
years.

## Making the open data initiative scale across all federal institutions

In 2016, we finally saw the opportunity to make open data scale to every
government institution at the federal level. As one of the last acts signed
by president Dilma Rousseff,
[Decree n. 8,777/2016](http://www.planalto.gov.br/ccivil_03/_Ato2015-2018/2016/Decreto/D8777.htm)
established that institution-wide open data plans, such as the ones that
had been running in the Ministry of Planning and the Ministry of
Justice, were to become mandatory for all federal ministries and
agencies (a freestyle translation of mine follows):

> § 2nd. The implementation of the Open Data Policy shall occur through
> the execution of an Open Data Plan within each body or entity under
> the direct, autarchic or foundational federal public administration,
> and it must include, at least the following topics:
>
> I - the creation and maintenance of data inventories and enterprise
> data catalogs;
>
> II - transparent mechanisms for prioritizing the opening of databases,
> which shall obey the criteria established by INDA and shall consider
> the data use and reuse potential by government as well as civil
> society;
>
> III - a schedule of the procedures to open databases, their update and
> improvement;
>
> IV - lay out clearly the roles and responsibilities of the
> administrative units in the body or entity of the federal public
> administration, related to the publishing, update, evolution and
> maintenance of the databases;
>
> V - the creation of processes for engaging citizens, with the goal of
> facilitating and prioritizing the opening of data, explain questions
> in the interpretation during use and to correct problems in the data
> already disclosed; and
>
> VI - other mechanisms to promote, to foster, and to effectively use
> the databases by society and by government. 

Getting over 200 hundred public institutions to make their own plans
like this in a timely manner was no easy task. Some of the key measures
to make that possible were:

* capacity building:
  * take the
    [early open data plans](https://dados.gov.br/noticia/ministerio-do-planejamento-divulga-plano-de-dados-abertos-pda)
    as examples and templates for making new ones;
  * make available a detailed, step by step
    [manual on how to create the plan](https://wiki.dados.gov.br/GetFile.aspx?File=%2fManuais%2fPlanos%20de%20Dados%20Abertos%2f2018%2fManual%20de%20Elaboracao%20de%20Planos%20de%20Dados%20Abertos.pdf&AsStreamAttachment=1&Provider=ScrewTurn.Wiki.FilesStorageProvider&NoHit=1);
  * extensively offer
    [courses on how to build the plan](https://wiki.dados.gov.br/Capacitacao-para-Elaboracao-de-Planos-de-Dados-Abertos.ashx);
  * visit the institutions from "door to door" and offer help with
    removing obstacles;
* communication:
  * feature the early and well made plans as positive examples for others
    to follow;
  * make sure that every organization receives notice of what they must
    do and how they must do it;
* monitoring:
  * the Office of the Comptroller-General (CGU), which was already
    responsible for auditing the federal administration, got a mandate
    in that decree to monitor the progress of these organizations in
    elaborating and implementing these institution-wide open data plans.

To face this great challenge, the core team that managed the open data
initiative was increased to six people. Some essential investment was
also made on offering the courses that trained almost 800 civil servants
with in-place workshops and almost 1,800 people in the distance
course.

<figure markdown="1" class="text-wide">
![one of the training sessions for public servants on how to plan for open data]({{ 'assets/images/2019/11/open-data-planning-training.jpg' | relative_url }})
<figcaption>One of the workshops on open data planning for public servants in the Brazilian federal government.</figcaption>
</figure>

Besides the open data plans being the main focus during 2016 and 2017,
some norms were deliberated upon and approved by the CGINDA:

* the committee's own bylaw,
* the open data portal's terms of use,
* [a norm](https://wiki.dados.gov.br/GetFile.aspx?File=%2fComiteGestor%2fResolu%c3%a7%c3%b5es%2fresolucao-cginda-3-13-10-2017.pdf)
  on how to elaborate the institution-wide open data plan.

Many others issues were discussed as well, such as: the revision of the
metadata standard in light of new international standards such as
[DCAT](https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-dcat-2/) by the W3C and the national
[application profiles](https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/asset/dcat_application_profile/description)
used by the EU, the ongoing audit by the TCU, the open data commitments
in the National Open Government Plan, participation on international
conferences about open data and other international exchanges, good
practices in protecting personal data before opening up data, how to
treat spatial data and related metadata standards, agreements with other
levels of government to federate open data portals, and more.

<figure markdown="1">
![Representatives of the committee gathered around a table watch a presentation]({{ 'assets/images/2020/12/cginda-2016.jpg' | relative_url }})
<figcaption>The CGINDA representatives gather at the 15th meeting, in November
2016.</figcaption>
</figure>

A recurring topic was also the placement of Brazil on international
rankings about open data, mainly the
[Open Data Index](https://index.okfn.org/place/br/) and
[Open Data Barometer](https://opendatabarometer.org/country-detail/?_year=2017&indicator=ODB&detail=BRA).
I always took the time to respond the surveys and questionnaires, to
look for data and other evidence that was already available and make
sure it was present in the answers. One obvious deficiency has always been
the difficulty in finding evidence of social and economic impact, and
this has been discussed in CGINDA. Companies that use open data do not
often tell in public what exactly are their data sources, so some
investment in surveying those is required. Other countries in Latin
America, like Mexico, had already investing in surveying private
companies that use open data, carrying out case studies in
[GovLab's Open Data 500](https://thegovlab.org/project/project-open-data-500-global-network).
I was already bringing to the committee's attention that the social and
economic impact of open data in Brazil had to be measured and actions had
to be taken to improve upon those impacts. More on the impact of open
data will be the subject of another blog post of mine.


## Stepping on the brakes and transition for a new management

By 2018, the prioritization of the digital transformation of services
was the reason alleged by the newly appointed senior staff to decide to
abstain from the responsibility of managing the initiative and to
transfer it to the CGU. The body had, until then, only been responsible to
monitor and audit federal institutions in their implementation of the
open data policy. The CGU had also been responsible for a long time for
the federal government's transparency policy. The transparency portal had
been inaugurated in 2004, even though structured data downloads came
much later. In the view of those decision makers, open data promotes
transparency, so efforts would be better concentrated if the leadership
of the open data policy was also placed in CGU's hands.

That is a valid train of thought. However, it can be argued that open
data is not just about transparency. Individuals and civil society
organizations can take open data to develop new solutions to societal
problems. Companies can use open data to create new and innovative
business models and also improve efficiency of existing ones. Research
has shown
[time](https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/mckinsey-digital/our-insights/open-data-unlocking-innovation-and-performance-with-liquid-information)
and
[time](https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/uk/Documents/deloitte-analytics/open-data-driving-growth-ingenuity-and-innovation.pdf)
[again](https://lateraleconomics.com.au/wp-content/uploads/omidyar_open_business.pdf)
how open data can impact even macroeconomic indicators like GDP, create
jobs and reduce government spending by increasing efficiency. It would make
sense to keep it at the newly created Ministry of Economy, where it was,
because those were the aspects of the open data policy that needed to be
most improved upon.

However, the decision was made. Personnel was allocated into other
projects, and no further investment into the open data initiative or the
portal was allowed until the transition was complete. I was encumbered
with the task of elaborating a new decree that would effect this
decision. That eventually became
[Decree n. 9,903/2019](http://www.planalto.gov.br/ccivil_03/_Ato2019-2022/2019/Decreto/D9903.htm).

I took the opportunity to tackle
[a long standing problem](https://www.ok.org.br/noticia/dados-meio-abertos-sobre-o-uso-e-reuso-dos-dados-governamentais-brasileiros/),
which was that different organizations in government would either pick
different open licenses for their datasets, or would leave no notice of
license at all. By defining an automatic open license for all of the
federal government open data, it would no longer require managers of
databases to decide about licenses on an individual basis. Any existing
database rights stemming from Brazilian copyright law (Law n.
9,610/1998) that could apply to datasets that were open would then be
[automatically authorized](https://dadosabertos.social/t/governo-federal-esta-proibido-de-utilizar-cc-nc/375/2)
for the public to use.

> Article 1st. Decree n. 8,777, from May 11th 2016, is now in force with
> the following changes:
> 
> > “Article 4th. Data made available by the federal Executive Branch and
> > the active transparency information are free for the Public Powers and
> > society to use.
> > 
> > Paragraph 1st. The free use of databases and of information made
> > available, stemming from no. XIII from the caput of
> > article 7th of Law 9,610, from February 19th 1998, and for which
> > the copyright holder is the Union, are authorized in the terms set forth
> > by article 29th of that law.
> > 
> > Paragraph 2nd. The federal Executive Branch is obliged to indicate the
> > holder of copyrights belonging to third parties and the conditions for
> > those authorized when making available databases protected by the
> > rights defined on no. XIII from the caput of article 7th of
> > Law n. 9,610, from 1998.” (NR)

The downsizing of the initiative meant, however, that the committee would
be able to meet only three times in 2018. In early 2019, what was already
slow came to a full stop when CGINDA was disbanded by
[Decree n. 9,759/2019](http://www.planalto.gov.br/ccivil_03/_ato2019-2022/2019/decreto/d9759.htm),
along with several other committees and commissions.

The open data plans and the new datasets did not stop, however, as
Decree 8,777/2016 was still in effect requiring government institutions to
do it. However, there was no more Open Data Action Plan and no more place
to discuss with civil society what was important to do in open data policy
at the federal level.

## A new beginning for the committee?

In May this year, the CGU has
[placed in public consultation](https://www.gov.br/cgu/pt-br/governo-aberto/noticias/2020/5/consulta-publica-sobre-reestruturacao-da-infraestrutura-nacional-de-dados-abertos-esta-disponivel)
a new norm that would supersede *Instrução Normativa n. 4* and reinstate
the CGINDA with a new composition. The proposal would increase the number
of civil society seats in the committee to five: two from organizations
that work with fostering transparency and open data, two from research
groups and one from the private sector. It also decreases the frequency
of meetings to once every four months, along with
[a number of smaller changes](https://dadosabertos.social/t/consulta-publica-sobre-a-infraestrutura-nacional-de-dados-abertos/373).
In the proposal that went under public consultation, all those five
representatives from civil society would be appointed by the CGU itself.
Considering the history of the open data movement and the previous
discussions within the committee itself, it would be advisable that some
kind of election among peers, like CGI.br has always done, be the
preferred method of choosing the representatives.

There is no government-wide Open Data Plan for all of INDA currently
standing, and elaborating one has already been stated as a first
priority by the CGU. When doing so, there should be some kind of social
participation as well. After all, as Thiago Rondon once pondered,
[the open data movement has an architecture of participation](https://www.ok.org.br/noticia/o-movimento-de-dados-abertos-tem-uma-arquitetura-de-participacao/).
