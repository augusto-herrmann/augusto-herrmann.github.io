  If you are a bank client in Brazil, the Central Bank is sharing with
  credit reporting agencies data on your relationship with your bank,
  as well details of any credit operations. And even if you are not a
  bank client, it receives back information on your payments to facilities
  such as those of water and energy bills.

As a follow-up to [the previous post]({{ reference_post.url | relative_url }}),
with help from Bruno Morassutti from
[Fiquem Sabendo](https://fiquemsabendo.com.br/), we found out that the
entirety of the agreements between Brazil's Central Bank (BCB) and the
credit reporting agencies is available at the institution's website
transparency section. They all have the same content, except for the
identification of the credit reporting agency, the respective internal
department and signatories. All five also share the same day of
signature: September 4th, 2023. Here are the links to each one of them:

* [Agreement with Boa Vista Serviços S.A.](https://www.bcb.gov.br/content/acessoinformacao/acordos_docs/ACORDO_64_2023-BCB_DESIG_ACT_BVS.pdf)
* [Agreement with QUOD Gestora de Inteligência de Crédito S.A.](https://www.bcb.gov.br/content/acessoinformacao/acordos_docs/ACORDO_61_2023-BCB_DESIG_ACT_QUOD.pdf)
* [Agreement with Serasa S.A.](https://www.bcb.gov.br/content/acessoinformacao/acordos_docs/ACORDO_71_2023-BCB_DESIG_ACT_Serasa.pdf)
* [Agreement with SPC Brasil](https://www.bcb.gov.br/content/acessoinformacao/acordos_docs/ACORDO_69_2023-BCB_DESIG_ACT_SPC.pdf)
* [Agreement with TransUnion Brasil Sistemas em Informática Ltda](https://www.bcb.gov.br/content/acessoinformacao/acordos_docs/ACORDO_10_2023-BCB_DESIG_ACT_TU.pdf)

## Data that the credit reporting agencies are sending BCB

The credit reporting agencies send the following data to the BCB, as
described in the second clause of the agreement. The first data exchange
will provide data relative to the preceding **12 months**.

### Monthly

* information on all your payments of facilities' bills
  * water and sewage
  * electricity
  * gas
  * telecommunications

### Quarterly

* your credit score

## Data that the BCB sends the credit reporting agencies

The BCB will send **monthly** the following data to the credit reporting
agencies, as set forth in the third clause of the agreement. The first
data exchange will provide data relative to the preceding **24 months**.

* bank client's identification, client type and date of beginning of
  relationship with the bank
* any contracted credit, including identification of the financial
  institution, type of operation, contract number, value, date of
  contracting and due dates and number of payments contracted
* any property pledged as collateral, including type and quantity
* accounting data on the credit operation, including outstanding balance,
  the value and due date of the next payment

## How to oppose the data transfer

If you are a Brazilian citizen and would like to object to the transfer
of your data, your only recourse is by formally manifesting your
opposition directly to any of the credit reporting agencies themselves.

You can do that online, by phone, by letter or even in person. But all
of them demand that you give them a lot of personal information and
documents, supposedly so that they can identify you – even though they
demand a lot more documents and information than would be sufficient to
identify someone. Just presenting any official document with the CPF
number should be enough for that. However, there are
[reported cases](https://tecnoblog.net/responde/como-sair-do-cadastro-positivo-cancelar-entrada/)
in which they also demand a phone number, e-mail, home address, date of
birth, place of birth, parents' names, a selfie, and more.
