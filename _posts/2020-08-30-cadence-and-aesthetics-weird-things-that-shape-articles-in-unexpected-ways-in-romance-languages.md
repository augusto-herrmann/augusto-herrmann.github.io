  In romance languages the way words sound can change articles in surprising
  ways. Let's take a look at some of those.

As a aspiring polyglot and amateur linguist, sometimes I find curious
similarities between grammar rules in different languages. One in particular
often surprises students when they first come across it, especially if
their native language has no such thing (for instance, Portuguese) or if it
uses no articles at all (as is the case of many Slavic languages, such as
Russian).

When you learn other languages, one of the first things you learn is that
nouns sometimes have a different gender than the corresponding one in
your native language. So you have to memorize the gender of nouns and practice
a lot. You also learn that you have to use articles, pronouns, and often
adjectives in accordance to the noun's gender (which is something unusual for
English speakers).

Then you come across things like

> El agua está fría.

in Spanish, which means “the water is cold”. Here the noun “*agua*” (water) is
feminine, which is in accordance with the feminine adjective “*fría*” (cold).
But the article employed here “*el*” (the) is masculine, instead of the feminine *la*. How come?

Or

> Mon amie est intelligente.

in French, meaning my (female) friend is smart. Likewise, the noun “*amie*"
(friend) and the adjective “*intelligente*” (smart) are feminine. Here, the
possessive pronoun “*mon*” (my) is masculine, instead of the feminine *ma*.
Very puzzling for French beginners indeed.

What gives?

## Morphing genders for sounding “right"

For Spanish speakers, “*la agua*” wouldn't sound right, and for Francophones,
"*ma amie*” sounds ugly for some reason. Every language has their own cadence
and phonemes that don't go well together and these are a couple of examples of
that. They tend to avoid joining vowels in adjacent words so you'd say

> Mon école est nouvelle.

(my school is new), with the masculine possessive pronoun “*mon*” instead of
the feminine “*ma*” (my), even though “*école*” (school) is a feminine noun.
However, if the next word does not start with a vowel, you should use “*ma*"
instead:

> Ma nouvelle école est incroyable.

(my new school is amazing).

## Many kinds of definite articles

Sometimes it's not the gender of articles that changes because of the
beginning of the next word, but a different type of article altogether.

Italian has
[different masculine definite articles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_grammar#Articles)
for singular, “*il*” and “*lo*” (more if you count “*l'* ”, which is an
[elision](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elision) of either “*lo*” or “*la*”,
the latter of which is feminine).
For masculine plural, there are two: “*i* ” and “*gli*”. Whenever a masculine
noun starts with a *z*, an *s* followed by a consonant or *gn*, as well as a
few other less common consonant groups, you use “*lo*” for singular, and
"*gli*” for plural. The latter is also used for plurals when the next word
starts with a vowel.

For instance:

> Gli animali sono grandi.

(the animals are large). If you arrange a word order such that the next word
does not star with a vowel, you get to use the more common “*i*” for plural:

> I grandi animali sono qui.

(the big animals are here).

If any other word starting with a vowel gets in the way, however, it's time
for “*gli*" again.

> Gli altri animali sono qui.

(the other animals are here).

This has to do with the cadence in Italian language. Cadence is the way sounds
in discourse create a certain rhythm. In Italian,
[vowel and consonant sounds tend to alternate with each other](https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammatica_italiana#L'articolo).
So it would sound strange to have too many consonants or too many vowels
lumped together.

Interestingly, though, this has not always been the case. Well known Italian
writers have used the forms “*il* ” and “*i* ” in ways that would be considered
incorrect today:

> Nowadays we say with ease *lo zio* (the uncle), *lo zappatore* (the digger),
*uno spergiuro* (a perjury), *gli stemmi* (the coat of arms), *gli zeffiri*
(the [Zephyr](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zephyrus)), *gli zaini* (the
satchels), *uno iettatore* (a jester), etc., however famous writers have
delivered: *il zio* (Cesari), *il zappatore* (Leopardi), *un spergiuro*
(Berchet), *i stemmi*, *i zeffiri* (Foscolo), *i zaini*, *un iettatore*
(D’Annunzio). A “centuries long” war has been waged between the two forms of
the definite and indefinite articles before consonants: *il* or *lo*?, *i* or
*gli*?, *un* or *uno*?

> [Corriere della sera – Dizionari: Il oppure lo? Si dice o non si dice?](https://dizionari.corriere.it/dizionario-si-dice/I/il-lo.shtml)

The current rule in Italian language codes what sounds pleasant to Italian
ears, something linguists call
[euphony](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phonaesthetics#Euphony_and_cacophony).

It is remarkable how aesthetic reasons (i.e. euphony) tend to put many
exceptions to the rules in languages. That happens not only in Romance
languages, but is present in languages from other branches as well. In
English, the rule for indefinite articles is to use *a* before consonants and
*an* before vowels. However, if the first letter of the next word is a vowel
that sounds like a consonant, *a* must be used instead. For example, since the
*u* in “university” sounds like a *y* when pronounced, you don't say “an
university”, but “a university”.

In all, language learners will inevitably fall for the stumbling blocks of
the exceptionalism of euphony and cadence when they first encounter them.
On the other hand, the experience and strange feelings when finding them will
also help remembering and internalizing these exceptions down the road, and
after some practice they will feel natural before you know it.
