  Notes taken by Augusto Herrmann during his participation in the course New
  Advances in Open and Digital Government, run on the week of 13th to 17th of
  May 2019, at Enap, lectured by Prof. Dr. Marijn Janssen of Delft Technical
  University in the Netherlands.

This week, once again, we were participating in the course
[New Advances in Open and Digital Government](https://www.enap.gov.br/index.php/pt/noticias/enap-da-inicio-ao-curso-internacional-novos-avancos-em-governo-aberto).
The course is lectured by
[Prof. Dr. Marijn Janssen of Delft Technical University](http://tbm.tudelft.nl/marijnj)
in the Netherlands, and is promoted in Brasília by the Secretariat for Digital
Government – SGD – and the National School of Public Administration – Enap.
This is the second time such a course was offered, after having debuted
in 2018. Most of the participants are public officials from many different
organizations in the Brazilian federal government.


In this series of posts I will share my main observations and comments on
the contents of the course. Note these are my own views and observations and
they do not represent in any way the positions and opinions of Prof. Janssen,
TU Delft, SGD or Enap.
When listening to the lectures and doing the course assignments, a lot
of thoughts, parallels and comparisons run through my mind. Registering
these thoughts is a way to avoid that those thoughts would slip away and to
encourage further discussions. It is also an opportunity to write about some
related issues and show examples that a lot of people might not have heard
before.

The first day of the course began with a review of what constitutes the
concept of open government, highlighting five pillars: openness, transparency,
accountability, participation and trust. Open government goes both ways.
It allows for society to oversee governments' operation, effectively
fighting misuse of public assets and improving its operations. On the other
hand, it allows governments to also leverage the collective intelligence
present in society to foster innovation within governments, through
collaborative practices.


Then we explored how we could leverage platforms to achieve a more
open government. But what are platforms? According to
[Hagiu & Yoffie (2009)](https://hbr.org/2009/04/whats-your-google-strategy),
"products, services or technologies that *connect* different types
of customers to each other". Using platforms, it is possible to use citizen
participation to explore the collective intelligence to solve common problems.
An example of such a participation is an offer to find direct volunteer
service to help others in need, and people create applications using open data
and services that will be used by others.


The second day began with a discussion on shared services centers. Which
services can be shared in an organization? How can we improve operations and
avoid redundant work? Creating shared services often requires a modular
approach to the components of government and enables reuse of these components.
This can save money, but  also additional administrative overhead is needed to
deal with that. Large organizations can do it internally, but it might not be
appropriate for very small organizations, as the overhead might undo the
potential efficiency gains. The way to proceed is collaborating with other
organizations. Shared services can also be seen as an attempt to balance the
advantages and disadvantages of centralization versus decentralization of
services structure. For example, a centralized approach would be to have a
single IT department that handles all of the IT in the organization. On the
other hand, a decentralized structure would have small IT teams scattered all
over the business units. The first is often inflexible and slow to change, but
highly efficient. The second is close to the user and can react faster to
changing needs, but will inevitably waste resources on redundant work.

Is it possible to balance the exploitation of existing capabilities when
exploring new opportunities? Organizations need
[ambidexterity](https://www.ambidextrie.de/what-is-ambidexterity)
to handle that double challenge. Prof. Janssen presented some
[strategies to accomplish this](https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/building-ambidexterity-into-an-
organization/).

That brings us to think about the subject of the third day, enterprise
architecture (EA). How do you structure your organization to face the
challenges of digital transformation, and how to innovate? Thinking about
enterprise-wide architecture also lets us reuse components of functional units
in similar contexts, e.g. different municipalities that have characteristics
and problems in common when serving citizens. EA should ensure a shared
direction and facilitating the means for this. Principles for directing are
essential.


In the next post, we will explore how data can be used to achieve an open
government and do social good. Also, we shall take a look on the content on
the second half of the course. See you soon!
