  My memories of aunt Therezinha, someone dear to me in my childhood.
  A reflection on the logic games and puzzles we played and how this
  shaped my thinking and love of mathematics for the rest of my life.

Therezinha Costa was born in Teixeira, Minas Gerais, Brazil in August
13th, 19XX (I won't say the exact year, later you will find out why),
daughter of Maria Luiza Costa and Antônio Domingos Costa, the youngest
among 8 siblings. Aunt Terô, as we affectionately called her, was my
grandmother Ana Luiza's sister. She was a smart, kind, and caring person,
very dear to everyone in the family. We used to turn to her for counsel
in many situations in life. She had a talent for helping us understand
ourselves better. In the words of my aunt Ana Lúcia, who is her niece,

> Tia Therezinha was a natural born psychologist! Se helped me a lot in
> situations with many emotional and existential conflicts. She was also
> in many respects a mother, such as in her attention, and out
> relationship stood very much in equal footing. That was very important
> to me!

That may have been one of the reasons why she decided to
study psychology, even at a relatively late age, and despite the many
obstacles she had to face in going to the university.

At the age of 9, she was afflicted with polio, which left her paralyzed
from the waist below. Despite her condition, she was a very active and
independent person and did most things herself. For example, in order to
reach something high on a shelf, she would often sit on the arms of the
wheelchair for support and get the thing. In situations she did need
help, however, it was very easy for others to do it because she kept
herself a very light body. Even so, the lack of accessibility then still
made life more difficult. In the 1980s in Brazil, almost no buildings
were accessible to people with reduced mobility. I remember my father
telling me that the faculty she went to did not have an entrance ramp and
she had to be carried up a long staircase in order to be able to access
her faculty classes. It's a good thing the laws have changed since then
and every building is required to have access ramps or elevators. She
would also sometimes having difficulty in finding a taxi willing to take
her along with the wheelchair.

As a kid, I enjoyed having long conversations with her at any time about
any subject. Sometimes, we talked at bedtime in the dark for what felt to
me like hours in my perception of a child, but that was most likely
around a half hour long. I remember we played many board and puzzle games
together, such as "Detetive" (a deduction board game manufactured by
[Estrela](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estrela_(company)), similar to
[Cluedo / Clue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cluedo)), "Cara a Cara"
([Guess Who](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guess_Who%3F)), "Resta Um"
([Peg solitaire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peg_solitaire)),
"[Cilada](https://pt.everybodywiki.com/Cilada_(jogo))" (Gridlock),
the Rubik's Cube and a world traveling board game whose name I do not
recall, and many others. She was especially fond of the
[Cup and Ball](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cup-and-ball) dexterity
game, which I liked too. In this game, the player holds a stick with a pin,
which is connected by a string to a ball. The player must move the stick
to throw the ball into the air, and then fit the pin in the small cavity
in the ball.

We also liked to draw together beautiful curves made with the
[Spirograph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spirograph), which I got as a
present from her, or from my father, I do not remember. If you don't know
what a spirograph is or the mesmerizing drawings it enables us to do,
think of a circle inside another tethered circle, connected by teeth
(like a cog), and with holes inside it for inserting a pen or pencil.
When the wheel turns, a curve appears. The shape of the curve depends on
many parameters, such as which hole you use or the size of the inner
wheel. Check out the Wikipedia page for more information, or the
animation below.

Those figures always got me thinking about whether or not the curve would
connect again at the beginning and, if so, how many turns of the wheel it
would take. I'm positive that all those puzzles and logic games have
influenced me and made me love mathematics.

When I was very young, I once took a cooled down piece of coal from the
fireplace and wrote "EAT" on it. My father initially thought I was hungry
for the word it formed in English, considering that I had started writing
at a quite young age, but then realized it was meant for the initials of
our names: Eduardo, Augusto, Therezinha.

Aunt Terô made the best
[pão de queijo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P%C3%A3o_de_queijo)
(or Brazilian cheese roll, a traditional and popular snack in state of
Minas Gerais) I have ever had the pleasure of eating. In her recipe,
later also reproduced by my father for many years, as I remember, took:

* [Cassava](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cassava) starch (of the
  "sweet", not "sour" variety)
* eggs
* butter
* milk
* [Canastra cheese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canastra_cheese)

Because I was a child, I do not remember or know the quantities used.
She, and later my father, would be very stringent in the rule that "sour"
cassava starch was never to be used and no cheese other than Canastra
cheese should go in the making of our pão de queijo. Canastra cheese is a
special type of cheese made in the
[Canastra Mountain Range](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serra_da_Canastra_National_Park)
region of the state of Minas Gerais, in Brazil.

I have found
[a version of a recipe](https://www.serradacanastra.com.br/queijo-canastra/receitas/pao-de-queijo-com-queijo-canastra-meia-cura)
(in Portuguese), that uses Canastra cheese. That recipe rather regrettably also
takes "sour" cassava starch 😬 besides the "sweet" one. Just kidding,
mixing the starch types is common practice and is not bad: the "sweet"
variety gives it ligature and elasticity; the acidic nature of the "sour"
favors fermentation more and makes it grow.

> #### Pão de queijo
> (recipe attributed to Mario)
> 
> * 200 _g_ cassava starch, sour type
> * 200 _g_ cassava starch, sweet type
> * 300 _g_ artisanal Canastra cheese, half ripe
> * 100 _g_ unsalted butter
> * 300 _g_ whole milk
> * 100 _ml_ water
> * 15 _g_ salt
> * 4 eggs
> 
> 1. In a large bowl, mix both starch types and the salt. In a small pan,
>    boil the water, milk and butter together. When they boil, mix with a
>    spoon and pour slowly all the liquid over the powder. Mix slowly with
>    a spoon and after it cools down also with your fingers.
> 2. Grate the cheese thick and add it along with the eggs. Mix everything
>    and knead the dough with the palms of your hands until the small
>    blobs of starch are gone, leaving only the pieces of cheese.
> 3. Grease your hands with a drop of oil and roll the dough into small
>    balls (20 _g_ each). Grease the baking tray or cover it in aluminium
>    foil and lay the *pães de queijo* set apart 3 _cm_ from each other.
> 4. Heat the oven to 180°C and bake them to your point of preference.

Aunt Therezinha's pão de queijo was most delicious. Sometimes I would
offer help in kneading the dough. However, as a child, I was too
impatient to wait the 30 minutes it takes to make in the oven. Once I
even tasted a tiny piece of it raw, despite it being ill advised by
adults, because the dough contains raw eggs, which carries the risk of
contamination. As Aunt Terô would say: "the hasty have it raw".

One of the last photos of her was taken by me with my Kodak I77XF
Instamatic Camera, which I used as much as my parents would give me film
for. Yes, cameras at the time were only capable of taking photos when
they had film, which would then need to be taking to a studio and be
developed. Despite what the name might suggest, unlike a Polaroid camera,
the camera does not print out any photos instantly. It takes 126 Kodak
film and takes pictures in the quite unusual square aspect ratio. One
could say that Kodak made square aspect ratio photos popular decades
before Instagram did. That photo would then be featured in the editorial
of a "magazine" I did, written in a typewriter.

The idea of the magazine I did as a child was to photocopy articles from
books and encyclopedias about subjects I found interesting, then
distribute it to family members. I asked Aunt Terô for her opinion on
what the subject of the second issue should be, and she suggested
chemistry. The issue is dated August 15th, 1990.

A translation follows:

> The subject of this issue is chemistry, at request from the person
> celebrating her birthday on August 13th, 1990.
> 
> Who is having a birthday? She's the one knitting there, to the left,
> look.
> 
> How old is she? That, I do not know, ask her. And even if I knew I can
> guarantee she would not like everyone to see her age here, for everyone
> to read.
> 
> The editor.

Looking at it today, the lack of spelling errors and playful tone of this
editorial have caught my attention.

She loved to knit. I remember having gloves, caps, and other clothes
knitted by her when I was a child. To this day I have a bed sheet made
by her.

Soon after that, in November 1990, a tragic car accident took her life
and her sister's Ana Luiza, who was my grandmother. My grandfather was
also gravely injured, but after a long hospital stay he recovered himself.
They all still live in our hearts and my childhood memories of the time
I spent with them are very dear to me.
