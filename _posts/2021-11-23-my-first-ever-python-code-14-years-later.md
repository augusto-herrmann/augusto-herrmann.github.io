  My personal experience with the Python programming language began as
  a tool for easily making calculations with large numbers in college,
  in order to study number theory. 14 years later, it's been a joyful
  journey of learning.

While browsing some old backups of mine I serendipitously came across
the first ever pieces of code I wrote in Python. It was back in 2007,
while I was an undergrad in Computational Mathematics, when I studied
the fundamentals of cryptography in college with professor Dr. Jeroen
van de Graaf at the
[Computer Science Department of the Federal University of Minas Gerais](https://dcc.ufmg.br/).
For the learning exercises, we needed to make calculations with large
integers, which was not something simple to do in many programming
languages at the time. Professor Jeroen suggested that we use Python for
that, and it turned out to be very easy to translate the abstract
algorithms from the books into running code.

We used many books on number theory and cryptography, but the one we
recurred to most often was the â€œHandbook of Applied Cryptography", by
Menezes, Oorschot and Vanstone, often mentioned by the acronym "HAC".
Many of the algorithms we implemented in the course were described in
that book.

The state of Python was quite different at the time, as the language has
evolved a lot over the years. I think I used Python version 2.3. Back
then, using the division operator `/` on integers would return integers.
Now you get a `float` instead. So in Python 3 you have to use the double
slash `//` for integer division if you want the result to be an `int`.

Furthermore, my own inexperience with the language is evident in the code
there. It is obviously apparent that I'm trying to imitate some C
language structures in several places. For example, I used a `for` loop
exactly like one would do in C, which is what I was used to at the time,
instead of iterating on a list. 

```python
for i in range(0 , t) :
    a = numbers[i]
# instead of the pythonic
for a in numbers[:t]:
    ...
```

On the other hand, it brings a smile to my face to see a header in that
file specifying the GPL 2 license for the code. My admiration for and
commitment to the free and open source software idea comes a long way.

So, what did I implement there? I'm not sure exactly which one I made
first, because the file modification timestamps are wrong â€“ they were
updated in a previous backup operation, but it's for sure one of those.
The code below tries to implement the
[Miller-Rabin algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miller%E2%80%93Rabin_primality_test)
for determining whether a number is composite or likely to be prime.
I'm not going to show the original code as it is implemented completely
wrong. Miller-Rabin is a probabilistic test, so it begins with the
choice of a random number $$ a $$, where $$ 2 \leq a \leq n - 2 $$. In
the exercise, I had used a fixed list of numbers instead. And that is
just one of many mistakes.

If you are curious as to how the Miller-Rabin test works, here is a
(hopefully) fixed version of my implementation of the algorithm
described in Chapter 4 of HAC:

```python
from random import randint
from colorama import Fore

def is_prime_MR (n: int, t: int) -> bool:
    """Checks whether a number is composite or likely to be prime using
    the Miller-Rabin probabilistic test.

    :param int n: The integer to be tested
    :param int t: Security parameter, large numbers take longer but
                  increase the probability of being prime

    :return: False if the number is composite, True if prime or pseudoprime
    :rtype: bool
    """
    if (n % 2 == 0) : return False
    r = n - 1
    s = 0
    while (r % 2 == 0):
        s = s + 1
        r = r // 2
    for i in range(t):
        a = randint(2, n - 2)
        y = pow (a, r, n)
        if (y != 1) and (y != n - 1):
            j = 1
            while (j < s) and (y != n - 1):
                y = (y * y) % n
                if y == 1:
                    return False
                j = j + 1
            if y != n - 1:
                return False
    return True

# test numbers from 4 to 400 with 10,000 iterations each
numbers = ' '.join(
    (Fore.RED if is_prime_MR(n, 10000) else Fore.WHITE) + f'{n:3}'
        for n in range(4, 401)
)
```

I also implemented the Pollard Rho algorithms for
[factorization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pollard%27s_rho_algorithm)
and for
[finding discrete logarithms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pollard%27s_rho_algorithm_for_logarithms),
as described in HAC, Chapter 3. One could immediately spot the extensive
use of lambda functions, which is interesting because:

* it helps a lot in implementing math algorithms such as this, and
* they were already present there this early in Python's history.

For the
[greatest common divisor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greatest_common_divisor)
we used the contemporary version of
[numbthy.py by Robert Campbell](https://github.com/Robert-Campbell-256/Number-Theory-Python/blob/master/numbthy.py#L54),
which is simple and useful for learning, but nowadays one would
probably prefer importing
[numpy's gdc](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.gcd.html)
which is calculated in C and would perform better. However, even with a
modern day computer I still could not find any factor of the composite
number 8834884587090814646372459890377418962766907 after an hour of
calculations. Maybe so if I had taken the effort to paralelize the
algorithm to benefit from today's multi-core CPUs, which I didn't. For
the smaller number 618240007109027021 though, it finds the factor
250387201 almost immediately. The code below was updated to Python 3, and
I advise you against using it as it may still contain errors. However, if
you must, then please proceed with caution:

```python
from numpy import gcd

def prho_factor (n: int) -> int:
    """Factors a composite number n that is not a power of a prime number.

    :param int n: A composite number n

    :returns: A non-trivial factor d of n
    """
    a = b = 2
    while True:
        g = lambda x : (x * x + 1) % n
        a, b  = g(a), g(g(b))
        d = gcd (a - b, n)
        if (d > 1) and (d < n):
            return d
        if d == n:
            break
```

Overall it was very interesting to revisit both these algorithms from
number theory and witness again the beginning my personal journey in
learning Python. According to the metadata in an OpenDocument text,
this code is just now completing its 14 anniversary. ðŸŽ‚ Yay!

This means that this marks the beginning of my 15th year with Python.
And still every day I learn something new. I can only anticipate the joy
of learning more Python on the next.
