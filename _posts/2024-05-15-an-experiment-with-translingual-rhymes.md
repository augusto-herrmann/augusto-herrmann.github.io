  My first attempt at creating verses that rhyme across multiple langauges.

For some time I have been curious about how words in one language could
possibly rhyme with words in a another language. Often sounds present in
one are absent in another. When composing a verse one must carefully
choose a word whose ending would have a phoneme that would have a close
approximation in the language of the next rhyming verse.

I searched around a bit, but could not find a poem that consistently used
this stylistic choice. It is understandable that this idea is not a
popular choice, perhaps due to the expectation that readers would need
to be fluent in two or more languages in order to understand it.

Despite that, I wanted to experiment with this idea. This is my first
attempt at this unconventional style of composition using four languages:
English, Portuguese, French and German.

> ### Finsternis
> 
> As I looked out the window <br/>
> algo estranho me assustou. <br/>
> Alles wurde plötzlich dunkel <br/>
> des étoiles visibles dans le ciel. <br/>
> 
> Finsternis aus dem Fenster hinaus <br/>
> é só impressão ou é real? <br/>
> Sans que je m'en rendre compte <br/>
> of all the time I spent. <br/>
> 
> So viel Zeit ist schon vorbei <br/>
> c'est déjà arrivée la nuit. <br/>
> Regrettably there is no way <br/>
> de recuperar o que desperdicei. <br/>


## Using AI for Translation

I have used an AI tool to speed up the translation of this blog post,
excluding the poem. The text was then manually revised by me afterwards.
This is also an experiment I have long wanted to try, as I have little
time to write and it takes a long time to manually translate all the
versions of each blog entry.

The verses themselves were, of course, manually written in their own
languages. Even though I can understand and communicate in those
languages reasonably well, I must admit that my knowledge of them is not
perfect. So I used an AI assistant for the sole purpose of detecting and
helping fix any grammatical errors, of which were just a couple. Out of
curiosity, I have also experimented asking it to generate one more
stanza. It got the language alternations between verses right, but
everything else was terrible: the words didn't rhyme at all and the
verses took a very uncreative direction. That part was to be expected
because language models are based on the probability of the next likely
word.

If you can't read all four of those languages, you're welcome to use
automated tools to translate them to your preferred language.


## Concluding Thoughts

In all, it was an interesting experience. While the challenges of
creating verses that rhyme across multiple languages are significant,
finding words that rhyme and make sense in the context is a good exercise
to my vocabulary and an enjoyable puzzle in itself. I found the process
to be creatively stimulating. I would like to do more of that.
