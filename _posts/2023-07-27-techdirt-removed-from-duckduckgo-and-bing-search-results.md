  Techdirt.com, a website that provides commentary and reporting often
  seen as critical of big tech companies and tech policy, has completely
  vanished from search engines such as Bind, DuckDuckGo and Ecosia. The
  reasons are as of yet unknown.

[Techdirt](https://techdirt.com/) is one of the go-to places to get well
informed about where technology and societal issues meet, about the often
unforeseen repercussions of proposed legislation on tech issues and tech
policy in general. Founded by Mike Masnick in the 1990s, it has a
frequently updated blog, a thriving community of people commenting every
post and is also a podcast. I have been an avid reader and listener since
the early days of the internet.

This morning I was trying to find an article on Techdirt, as I usually do
to find references to texts I write on this blog. Being a privacy
conscious person, I always use DuckDuckGo for my searches. To my
surprise, I couldn't find any search results at all from the techdirt.com
domain name, even if I used the `site:` filter to restrict the search.

<figcaption>DuckDuckGo shows that no results at all have been found for site:techdirt.com.</figcaption>
</figure>

When searching for the site's name, only results for pages about Techdirt
on Wikipedia, Twitter, Patreon, Wired, etc. would show up, but still not
any page on the techdirt.com domain name itself.

Strange, indeed. It's not my first kind of experience like this with DDG,
though. Months ago I had a really hard time finding
[an article my friend Yasodara Cordova had written in 2018 for The Intercept Brazil](https://theintercept.com/2018/08/10/whatsapp-facebook-gratis-fake-news/),
related to
[her research in Berkman Klein Center for Internet & Society in Harvard](https://cyber.harvard.edu/people/ycordova),
but which is also a very critical piece on Big Tech. That article now
shows up easily in DDG, though.

Searching around a bit I found previous claims that DDG would remove
results related to
[alleged piracy](https://torrentfreak.com/duckduckgo-restores-pirate-sites-and-points-to-bing-220419/)
or
[alleged Russian propaganda](https://betanews.com/2022/03/13/is-microsoft-to-blame-for-duckduckgo-censoring-russian-search-results/),
and they always do lay the blame on Bing. I couldn't find, though, any
case of DDG removing results related to critical thinking on tech policy.
That is indeed a first.

I tried to remember the names of other search engines that at least claim
to be privacy oriented, so I could continue my search. Ecosia came to
mind – they are featured as a search engine option in Firefox.
Unfortunately, I found the very same problem there as DuckDuckGo had.

<figure markdown="1">
![Screenshot of an Ecosia search for "site:techdirt.com". No results found for site:techdirt.com]({{ 'assets/images/2023/07/ecosia-techdirt-2023-07-27T12-06-51.png' | relative_url }})
<figcaption>Ecosia, too, shows no results at all for site:techdirt.com.</figcaption>
</figure>

Then I remembered the fact that DuckDuckGo (and most likely Ecosia, too)
gets its search results from Bing, and then tried searching there directly.

<figure markdown="1">
![Screenshot of a Bing search for "site:techdirt.com". The results page says "some results have been removed".]({{ 'assets/images/2023/07/bing-techdirt-2023-07-27T14-35-50-en.png' | relative_url }})
<figcaption>Bing search claims that some results have been removed.</figcaption>
</figure>

Still no results are displayed on Bing, but at least they do acknowledge
the fact that "some" results have been removed. The link there does
nothing to explain the reason why the whole site has been de-indexed,
but is a
[rather generic Bing support page](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/how-bing-delivers-search-results-d18fc815-ac37-4723-bc67-9229ce3eb6a3)
explaining several possible reasons that might cause Microsoft to remove
pages from Bing search results.

Being busy and not able to write this blog post right away, I decided to
inform Techdirt about the problem through the contact form on their site.
Later in the day, I saw that Mike Masnick had written
[a blog post](https://www.techdirt.com/2023/07/27/techdirt-has-been-deleted-from-bing-and-duckduckgo/)
about the problem, mentioning having received a message from *someone*
(yours truly) and basically speculating about the possible reasons for
the site's sudden disappearance from all those search engines. It even
has a funny piece on asking Bing's AI bot about the reasons behind the
site's removal.

Among the speculative reasons dreamed by the generative AI, the two most
plausible seem to be either some kind of bug or technical issue, or
censorship due to the political stance of Techdirt, which is very often
critical of companies such as Microsoft, who many times have been accused
of abusing their market dominance position to thwart the competition.

> And the last one is of course possible: that Microsoft encountered
> “some legal or political pressure to remove or censor Techdirt.com,
> which is known for its critical and investigative reporting on various
> topics, such as technology, law, policy, and business,” but it would be
> nice if someone would just, you know, let me know?

Masnick explicitly claims to believe the former to be the case, and goes
out of his way to remark the fact that Bing has every right to remove
whatever they want for whatever reason (though it of course makes me and
many people even less prone to use their search engine).

[Someone commented](https://www.techdirt.com/2023/07/27/techdirt-has-been-deleted-from-bing-and-duckduckgo/#comment-3181186)
at that post that other sites critical of the way Silicon Valley thinks
of tech policy were supposedly being removed as well and cited as an
example
[Tech Won't Save Us](https://www.techwontsave.us/) (an excellent podcast
by Paris Marx that I highly recommend, right beside others such as
[Your Undivided Attention](https://www.humanetech.com/podcast),
[Team Human](https://www.teamhuman.fm/),
[The Cory Doctorow Podcast](https://craphound.com/podcast/) and Techdirt
itself). However, I searched for all of those on DDG and they were all in
fact showing up as they normal would. So either they have somehow fixed
the rest of the websites, but not Techdirt, really quick or this person
is simply mistaken.

Later the user NoahVail
[pointed out in the comments](https://www.techdirt.com/2023/07/27/techdirt-has-been-deleted-from-bing-and-duckduckgo/#comment-3181184)
that
[DDG's CEO/Founder was looking into the problem](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36898217#36898661)
and indeed, earlier in the evening I could see that at least a link to
the main techdirt.com website was indeed back again appearing in DDG's
search results, but still not any links to other pages and articles.

<figure markdown="1">

<figcaption>The main Techdirt.com page now appears in DuckDuckGo, searched earlier in the evening. Still no links to articles, though.</figcaption>
</figure>

I'm guessing that to show deeper links to Techdirt they would need to crawl
the website, and that they're entirely reliant on Bing for that. So it
will probably take a while to fix.

In the meantime, I found out that another privacy oriented search
engine is not having this problem, because they crawl the web themselves
instead of relying on other larger search engines. It's called
[Mojeek](https://www.mojeek.com). For some reason, though, they have the
annoying tendency of sometimes blocking my searches because they mistake
my behavior for a bot, especially if I search for technical error
messages, copying and pasting them (which is something extremely common
that programmers do several times a day).
