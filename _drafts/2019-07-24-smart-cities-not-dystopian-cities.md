  Reflections on how, when considering smart cities initiatives, if we don't
  pay due attention to the human perspective and don't properly address the
  use of open data and open standards, it may bring us closer to a digital
  dystopia.

When one thinks about smart cities, what comes to mind? The common sense
view, often portrayed in the traditional media, is that of advanced
technology in an urban setting, serving some need or enabling some service.
Seldom, if ever, do we ever think about the processes used to create those
services, who benefits from them, and who is empowered by them. But these
often neglected aspects of smart city policy development may make the
difference between authoritarian dystopia powered by advanced tech and
a digital dawn of civic empowerment and participation.

In July of 2015, I was invited to take part in meetings of a fledgling
interministerial working group intent on discussing the arrangement of
different federal government policies that could be related to smart cities
development. The reason for the invitation was my involvement, from the
beginning, with the government's
[open data program](http://wiki.dados.gov.br/). Soon in the working group
meetings, an European expert was invited to talk: Dr. Álvaro de Oliveira,
from the [European Network of Living Labs](https://enoll.org/)  – ENoLL.
[According to Joelle Mastelic](https://openlivinglabdays.com/call-for-papers/),
a council member of ENoLL,

> A Living Lab is an innovation intermediary, which orchestrates an ecosystem
> of actors in a specific region. Its goal is to co-design product and
> services, on an iterative way, with key stakeholders in a public private
> people partnership and in a real-life setting. One of the outcomes of this
> co-design process is the co-creation of social value (benefit). To achieve
> its objectives, the Living Lab mobilises existing innovation tools and
> methods or develop new ones.

In his talk, Dr. Álvaro stated that we ought to consider to encourage the
development of not just smart cities, but
[smart human cities](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/305854285_From_Smart_Cities_to_Human_Smart_Cities).
