Last March I was at one of the two
[Open Data Day Rio de Janeiro](http://arquivonacional.gov.br/br/ultimas-noticias/2043-6-de-marco-open-data-day-no-arquivo-nacional)
events, which was organized by the *Arquivo Nacional*, the National Archives
of the Brazilian federal government. I was invited to give a talk there about
the Open Data Day itself: what it is, why is it important, and how have some
previous ODD events been like. This post is about my personal impressions of
the ODD overall event and some reflections on the topic of my own talk. It can
be considered a written summary, or rather a companion of sorts, to the
contents of that talk.

The recording of the talk (in Portuguese)
[is available on Youtube](https://youtu.be/-1mR2gz_4Hg?t=780) and the slides
[are on SlideShare](https://pt.slideshare.net/AugustoHerrmannBatis/open-data-day-2020-arquivo-nacional-rio-de-janeiro).

Please note that most of this was written in the beginning of March 2020,
before the new coronavirus pandemic had been declared a pandemic by the World
Health Organization, completely changing events around the world to be online
only. However, much of the lessons learned from Open Data Day
events are still valid, except perhaps for the ones related to the physical
venues. Those have not been removed, though, considering that hopefully, once
a vaccine is around, physical events can happen once again.

If you are thinking about the next Open Data Day in 2021, and how to make
preparations and adaptations for an online format if necessary at the time,
perhaps we could take some lessons learned from
[this post](https://blog.okfn.org/2020/06/17/lessons-learned-from-organising-the-first-ever-virtual-csvconf/)
written collaborative by the csv,conf,v5 organizing team, which includes
Lilly Winfree and Jo Barratt.

## What is the Open Data Day and how to make one

For that talk, I took as inspiration a
[Guide for the Open Data Day 2020](https://github.com/okfn-brasil/embaixadoras/blob/master/Guia-ODD/Guia-ODD2020.md)
that the *Embaixadoras* project of Open Knowledge Brasil had produced, as a
result of a
[webinar](https://br.okfn.org/2020/01/13/open-data-day-2020-descubra-como-fazer-na-sua-cidade/)
I took part on in January. The [recording](https://youtu.be/MGceIuNm2xY) (in
Portuguese language) is available on Youtube. In it, we discussed some tips
for organizing an ODD event.

<figure markdown="1">

The [Open Data Day](https://opendataday.org) is a decentralized event, where
people in many places around the world gather to celebrate open data and to do
activities related to open data. These activities vary a lot. They can be, for
instance:

* exploring data sets to get to know the possibilities of using them to solve
  real world problems;
* talks about any topic related to open data;
* hackathons, data analysis and software development in projects that use
  open data;
* round tables and Q&A sessions between data users and data publishers.

### Why is it important?

Why does it matter? Well, it's an opportunity to get people together to
discuss things related to open data. It's often the case that each one
works in their open data related project on their own, and don't know
what the others are doing or how they can benefit from cooperation. It's
a rare occasion where you have a critical mass of people interested in
open data who can work together to solve real world problems with data.
It is also a great opportunity to expand your network of contacts to more
people that are involved in the data use landscape, so many interesting
new connections usually happen in those events.

However, the Open Data Day isn't just for experts in the matter, or even just
for technically inclined people. As it's an inclusive event, people
who have never had any contact with open data before can feel welcome and
figure out a way to help with something useful and meaningful. And, of course,
to learn and practice skills in an environment where it's easy to get help
when you need it, since more experienced people will often will be in reach
and willing to help.

### Getting started in organizing an event

Since the event is decentralized, you don't have to ask permission to anyone
in order to plan a new one in your community. Just think of a few things to do
there, by preparing activities related to a project or two that people might
want to volunteer to. It's often the case that people come over willing to
collaborate, but have no idea about what to do. So having some suggestions
ready for possible activities is something pretty useful. Having a talk
prepared to introduce newcomers to ongoing projects that you intend to work on
is also important.

### Finding and preparing data

Make sure you also introduce the datasets that could be useful for the planned
activities and share with everyone the links to them. Look for datasets in the
official sources, data portals, government websites and transparency portals,
national statistics offices, international organizations (e.g.
[World Bank](https://data.worldbank.org/), [UN](http://data.un.org/),
[OECD](https://data.oecd.org/)), and corporate open data catalogs (e.g.
[data.world](https://data.world/),
[Open Corporates](https://opencorporates.com/)).
Sometimes there are also useful community curated data catalogs
(e.g. [The Data Hub](https://datahub.io/), [DBPedia](http://dbpedia.org/) or
[WikiData](https://www.wikidata.org/)), so don't forget to check those too.
If you don't know where to start, you can also browse lists of data portals
that might be relevant to you at [dataportals.org](https://dataportals.org/),
[Open Data Inception](https://opendatainception.io/), and other community
curated lists and data portals that are relevant to your location.

![Dataportals.org website with map and clusters of data portals around the world.]({{ 'assets/images/2020/08/data-portals.gif' | relative_url }})

### Who to invite

Speaking of the datasets, if you are a public official responsible for the
publication of datasets or can get in touch with some and invite them, it
would be a great addition to the event. No one is in a better position to
explain to the participants whatever questions they might have about the
meaning, structure and context of data. That way, you can avoid people getting
stuck on roadblocks when implementing their ideas. This will also be
beneficial to the data publisher, as they can get very useful feedback
directly from data users on how to improve data quality and documentation.

It is also useful to have domain experts participate in the Open Data Day.
Send invitations to communities that might be interested in working on the
projects you're planning to do. Not only tech communities, but also ones
related to the field of work related to the project. For instance, if it's an
environment related project, get in touch with environment protection groups.
If it's a health or transportation related issue, do the same.

Find out if are there in your location hacker spaces, hacker clubs and other
associations that have activities related to open data or the use of data.
If so, they are usually interested in at least participating and helping
promote it in social media, if not more. Participants from these groups are
often very qualified and can help in achieving the projects' goals and getting
newcomers on board faster with using data.

<figcaption>The Open Data Day Bras√≠lia 2017 event was a collaboration between
Calango Hacker Club, which is a local hackerspace, and the Ministry of
Culture.</figcaption>
</figure>

In the January webinar, [Thays Lavor](https://twitter.com/thayslavor) stated
that, in her experience with
"[Beer with Data](https://www.ok.org.br/projetos/cerveja-com-dados/)" events,
it was a good thing to make the event in an open space, so that some people
walking by became curious about it and eventually engaged and participated in
it.

### Support and infrastructure

If you can get official support from government or academic institutions,
civil society organizations and businesses, it could help in many ways.
They could sponsor or improve the infrastructure of the event, such as the
use of space, equipment or even in getting the word out about it. Another
possibility of support is to apply for the
[mini grants](https://blog.okfn.org/2020/01/16/announcing-the-launch-of-the-open-data-day-2020-mini-grant-scheme/)
offered each year
by the Open Knowledge Foundation and other partners.

Another possibility is to open up space in the event schedule and encourage
participants to communicate over the internet with another Open Data Day
event in another city. Since events happen on the same day, this is often
possible and will cross-pollinate ideas between them.

### Location and getting the word out

As for the venue, make sure you book the place in advance. Places can be
public buildings, universities, libraries, schools, etc. But also non-profit
and corporate places can often be used for free on non-working days (the ODD
usually takes place on Saturdays) if you tell them about the event and ask
them to use the space. It's also very important to make sure that the place
does have a decent wifi connection for participants to use. It will be
frustrating for everyone if they can't easily download datasets and tools for
analysis. Don't leave these arrangements to the last minute or your event
might not happen.

Don't forget to announce the event to all of the relevant groups by direct
contact and by using social media. Also, head to opendataday.org and include
your event on the map there.

### Other resources

In 2018, the Open Knowledge Foundation set up an
[Open Data Day Organizer's guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1F-osa6HETh4JVSywk4NXbzjtLzXXdnrRx1Yr-tU-5vQ/edit)
(hosted in Google Docs) that should be useful for anyone thinking about
setting up their own local event.

In order to adapt the event to an online only format, check out, if you
haven't already, the aforementioned
[lessons learned post](https://blog.okfn.org/2020/06/17/lessons-learned-from-organising-the-first-ever-virtual-csvconf/)
from the csv,conf,v5 event.

Lastly, take a look at the experiences from previous Open Data Day events.
You might get cool ideas of things to do and also get tips from ["lessons

## An (incomplete) history of ODD events in Brazil

As a product of having to talk about the Open Data Day itself, I had to
research a bit of the history of the events in Brasil. A big challenge in
finding out information about ODD events lies in the fact that it is in fact
a number of decentralized events organized by local groups. Quite often, as
soon as one year has passed, the event no longer has a web page online.
There used to be a wiki, hosted by Open Knowledge, where most of them were
registered, but it has been since shut down.
Thankfully, the Web Archive has a copy of some of those pages.

Even though the ODD apparently
[debuted in London in 2010](http://dev.fernandobrito.com/2016/03/open-data-day-2016-joao-pessoa-brazil/),
the earliest records I could find of the event in Brazil was
[in 2013](https://web.archive.org/web/20180314215648/http://wiki.opendataday.org/2013/City_Events#Brasil):
S√£o Paulo,
[at the House of Digital Culture](https://web.archive.org/web/20160105185538/http://wiki.opendataday.org/SaoPauloODD-SP2013),
and Bras√≠lia,
[at the Auditing and Control Institute](https://web.archive.org/web/20160105185030/http://wiki.opendataday.org/Bras%C3%ADliaODD-DF2013).
In 2014, different cities represented the Open Data Day in Brazil: Rio de
Janeiro and Vit√≥ria. 2015 saw the number of events in Brazil be multiplied
threefold:

* [Bras√≠lia](https://calango.club/eventos/oficinas/opendataday2015), organized
  by the [Calango Hacker Club](https://calango.club/)
* [Porto Alegre](https://matehackers.org/opendatadaypoa2015), organized by
  [Mate Hackers](https://matehackers.org/), a local hackerspace, the
  [House of Digital Culture](http://ccdpoa.com.br/) and Poa Digital (there is a
  [video summary](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vSds2pPDmMY)), in Portuguese,
  on Youtube)
* S√£o Carlos, with round tables about [Sigalei](https://www.sigalei.com.br/)
* [S√£o Paulo](https://web.archive.org/web/20190219193120/http://cafehacker.prefeitura.sp.gov.br/participantes-do-dia-internacional-de-dados-abertos-criam-projetos-sobre-crise-da-agua-e-fazem-pedidos-para-abertura-de-novas-bases/),
  a hackathon with projects against the water shortage crisis in the city and
  also to write freedom of information requests to the local government
* Teresina, with a transparency hackathon
* Vila Velha

</figure>

[In 2016](https://www.ok.org.br/noticia/open-data-day-sera-comemorado-dia-5-de-marco-confira-os-eventos-no-brasil/),
there were events in Bras√≠lia, Campina Grande, Jo√£o Pessoa, Macei√≥ and Vit√≥ria.

In 2017, the Bras√≠lia event had activities related to
[Opera√ß√£o Serenata de Amor](https://serenata.ai/), an initiative to track
expenses by members of parliament, Ushahidi, Open Street Map and programming
dojos.

There were also events at
[Curitiba](https://www.ok.org.br/noticia/codeacross-curitiba-reune-membros-do-governo-e-sociedade-civil/),
[Macei√≥](https://www.ok.org.br/noticia/open-data-day-maceio-acontece-inicio-marco/)
and two in S√£o Paulo. One of them, organized by Open Knowledge Brasil, had
activities to develop
[Querido Di√°rio](https://www.ok.org.br/projetos/querido-diario/), a project
that aims to eventually be able to scrape all of the official gazettes from
Brazilian states and municipalities.
[The other one](https://polignu.org/noticias/open-data-day-sp-2017) was
organized by PoliGNU, PoliGen, MariaLab and Transpar√™ncia Hacker and used
open data to discuss the participation of women in public policies.

### 2018

The year
[2018](https://blog.okfn.org/2018/03/02/open-data-day-2018-
what-do-we-celebrate-and-why/)
got the greatest number of Open Data Event in Brazil yet.

In [Bras√≠lia](https://calango.club/eventos/oficinas/opendataday2018), once
again we met at the Ministry of Culture. At first, we intended to do some
practical programming and data wrangling activities, but we ended up with
a roundtable of conversations where we told the story of how we got the open
data policy in Brazil going, starting in 2010, and people got to ask questions
about it and about open data in general. The
[video recording](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hl7vyxqKQEY) of the event is available on Youtube.

<figure markdown="1">

<figcaption>From the left, Augusto, <a href="https://carneiro.blog.br/">Ot√°vio
</a> and Christian, members of the Calango Hacker Club introduce the story of
how open data got started in Brazil.</figcaption>
</figure>

A written account of an important chapter in that story, the collaborative
building of the federal government open data portal with civil society using
free and open source software, is available
[at dados.gov.br](dados.gov.br/pagina/processo-de-participacao-social-da-inda).

The
[Open Data Day in Macei√≥](https://www.ok.org.br/noticia/como-foi-o-opendataday2018-em-maceio-e-em-porto-alegre/)
started a day early, on Friday, March 2nd, and went on to Saturday. There were
roundtables of conversation with data users and publishers, an exploration of
data on the state of Alagoas' open data portal and a hackathon.

[Porto Alegre](https://medium.com/@irio/opendataday-2018-em-porto-alegre-21b21b6203ab)
had a series of talks and round tables with public officials, auditors from
courts of account, data journalists and other activists. A hackathon for civic
tools for the then upcoming 2018 election was also
[planned there](https://portal.tce.rs.gov.br/portal/page/portal/tcers/administracao/gerenciador_de_conteudo/noticias/TCE-RS%20participa%20do%20Open%20Data%20Day).

In [S√£o Paulo](https://blog.okfn.org/2018/04/11/advancing-in-consolidating-an-open-data-community-and-practitioners-in-south-america/),
[Artigo 19](https://artigo19.org/), a civil society organization dedicated to
promoting human rights, organized a private ODD event at
[MobiLab](http://mobilab.prefeitura.sp.gov.br/), an open innovation lab in
the local administration. The activities centered around research data on
femicides and how to use that data.

[Raul Hacker Club](https://raulhc.cc/), a local hackerspace, hosted
[the ODD in Salvador](https://raulhc.cc/Agenda/2018-03-03-OpenDataDay). There
was
[a data scraping workshop](https://github.com/fmasanori/treinamento)
by activist Fernando Masanori and a presentation about Salvador in the
[Brazilian cities Open Data Index](https://br.okfn.org/2017/10/04/indice-de-dados-abertos-vai-ser-apresentado-em-mais-de-10-municipios-brasileiros-em-2018/).

In addition to those, there were also events at the following cities:

* Curitiba (Movimenta Curitiba)
* Fortaleza (at the Federal University of Cear√°)
* Natal (LabGov ‚Äì UFRN)
* Rio de Janeiro (Rio Criativo)

Reports of all of the Open Data Dat events around the world that have received
mini-grants can be found
[here](https://blog.okfn.org/2018/06/07/open-data-day-2018-this-years-celebration-of-a-growing-community/).

### 2019

In 2019, for the first time, the Open Data Day in Brazil was split into
different dates. Carnival is a major national holiday when most people are
unavailable and venues are closed, so hosting an event like this faces major
roadblocks. So, some local events decided to go early (March 9th) while others
went late (March 23rd). For
[the first round of events](https://www.ok.org.br/noticia/saiba-o-que-aconteceu-na-primeira-rodada-do-open-data-day-2019/),
we had the ODD in four Brazilian cities.

Mapping activities sponsored by one of the mini-grant themes
took place in both
[Curitiba and S√£o Paulo](https://www.ok.org.br/noticia/mapeamento-aberto-no-brasil-no-open-data-day-2019/).
The latter was an effort organized by Wiki Movimento Brasil to collect
structured data about mining dams in Brazil, after the
[2019 Vale dam disaster in Brumadinho](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brumadinho_dam_disaster),
and to store them on [WikiData](http://wikidata.org/). A map of those mapped
dams can be seen
[here](https://w.wiki/Y4p).
The former was the 1st Map-a-thon for Urban Accessibility in Curitiba, where
39 occurrences of accessibility problems in the city were mapped by teams of
volunteers and made available online on a map. Besides that,
[ODD Curitiba](https://www.codeforcuritiba.org/2019/04/17/como-foi-o-open-data-day-curitiba-2019/#page-content)
had sessions on open science, the tracking of public money flows, and mass
transit.

[ODD Porto Alegre](https://medium.com/@taisecoisas/chuva-de-dados-e-um-banho-de-energia-no-open-data-day-poa-2019-cb4bafc8ca6c)
had a series of talks from specialists on the tracking of public expenditures
using open data, who showed their respective projects. There were also talks
about open data time series from the national statistics office ‚Äì IBGE, open
data for smart cities, using blockchain technology for transparency, and the
use of open data by data journalists.

<figure markdown="1">
![Participants of the ODD Porto Alegre listen to a talk.]({{ 'assets/images/2020/08/odd-poa-2019.jpg' | relative_url }})
</figure>

[In Recife](https://www.sympla.com.br/open-data-day---recife__470765), the
event had talks about local open data portals, research experience on open
data of the state of Pernambuco and local civic tech projects.

The [second round of events](https://www.ok.org.br/noticia/23-03-segunda-rodada-de-eventos-do-open-data-day/),
on March 23rd, had a few more cities join the Brazilian Open Data Day:
Fortaleza and Natal. The
[ODD Fortaleza](https://www.ok.org.br/noticia/open-data-day-fortaleza-2019-os-highlights-do-evento/)
included talks, workshops, webinars and debates. Many of the workshops taught
participants how to the R language: introduction, web scraping, data
visualization and more. One of the practical results was to extract data on
the expenses done by members of the state parliament. The talks, debates,
and webinars discusses public transparency, access to information and civic
tech. On the same day, there was an ODD event also at
[Natal](https://www.outgo.com.br/opendatadaynatal2019).

### 2020

This year has been
[the biggest Open Data Day yet in Brazil](https://www.ok.org.br/noticia/saiba-como-foi-o-open-data-day-2020-pelas-cidades-do-brasil/),
as the usual map on the ODD website had registered 15 events at the time.
Most of them took place on March 6th and 7th, but there were also a couple of
late events that went online due to the outbreak of the pandemic.

<figure markdown="1">

<figcaption>Map of the open data day events, showing 15 entries in Brazil.</figcaption>
</figure>

In
[ODD S√£o Paulo](https://www.ok.org.br/noticia/quer-saber-como-foi-o-open-data-day-2020-em-sao-paulo-veja-todos-os-detalhes/),
the talks were about open elections data and parliamentary activity open data.
Some of the practical activities involved exploring the API from CEPESP of Funda√ß√£o Get√∫lio Vargas with curated data about elections in Brazil, such as [the amount
of property declared by candidates in the 2018
elections](https://medium.com/somos-tera/o-que-eu-aprendi-com-o-open-data-day-e-com-os-bens-declarados-pelos-candidatos-%C3%A0-presid%C3%AAncia-do-2105c4fb2ec2).

Besides the aforementioned ODD event on the premises of Arquivo Nacional on
Friday, there was also another ODD event in Rio de Janeiro organized by the
*Cerveja com Dados* (Beer with Data) group, on Saturday. The talks explored
diverse themes such as open data about the local environment, trying to
predict school evasion with open education data, and
[shared bicycles](https://embaixadoras.ok.org.br/events/open-data-day-rio-de-janeiro-2020/).

Rio wasn't the only Brazilian city to have two ODD events in 2020. Recife
got
[two events as well](https://www.dadosabertospernambuco.com.br/post/recifetemduplacomemora%C3%A7%C3%A3oodd2020).
One of them was organized by IP-rec and the Women in Data Science Recife
group, with support by Neurolake, and took place in the morning of March
7th. There were talks about the civic apps Fogo Cruzado and Aetrapp and
a debate between data journalist and a public official, on using open data
about violence against women. In the afternoon, the second event was
organized by
[Pernambuco Transparente](https://www.instagram.com/pernambucotransparente/)
and supported by Livraria Jaqueira. It had talks on using open data platforms
and access to information law, smart, egalitarian and sustainable cities,
tracking of public spending, open mapping and data journalism. You can find
a detailed account of both events at the *Dados Abertos Pernambuco* blog
post linked above.

[Natal](https://embaixadoras.ok.org.br/events/open-data-day-natal-2020/) had
an extensive two day event,
[filled with talks and even mini-courses](https://sigeventos.ufrn.br/evento/opendataday2020/principal/view):

> In total, there were fourteen talks; a video conference directly from Paris;
two panels (one about face recognition technologies; and another about open
data, ethics and democracy); a mini-course about web data indexing with
Python; and a workshop on creating charts with R.

The [Manaus](https://embaixadoras.ok.org.br/events/open-data-day-manaus-2020/)
Open Data Day had a series of talks on many themes: digital transformation,
the new Brazilian data protection law, AI, and the open data ecosystems and
business models.

The data protection law as also a theme of the debates in
[ODD Belo Horizonte](https://www.sympla.com.br/open-data-day---belo-horizonte__796449),
as well as data from the judiciary, information security and the Brazil in
Data project.

In
[Curitiba](https://www.codeforcuritiba.org/2020/03/03/open-data-day-curitiba-2020/#page-content),
the Code for Curitiba group organized a marathon of civic innovation on the
theme "Data for Egalitarian Development". The participating teams coded for
two projects:

* [√înibus.IO](https://github.com/CodeForCuritiba/onibus-io), a community
  project to share open data on Curitiba's public bus system; and
* DS156, an initiative that aims to use the city's open data on the service
  call center (which answers by the number 156 in the city) and translate it
  into actionable advice for public officials.

In
[Campinas](https://www.sympla.com.br/open-data-dextra-day__776884), a
datathon on using open data about Brazilian municipalities was sponsored
by Dextra.

In [Santos](https://github.com/Py013/Open-Data-Day-2020), the Py013 group
organized an ODD event with support by 4Linux, Alura and Casa do C√≥digo,
in which the participants did some exploratory data analysis using Python
and Jupyter Notebooks.

The Porto Alegre event this time dealt with environmental data and discussed
the Gua√≠ba mine project and its impact on the Porto Alegre metropolitan area.

One of the late events that went online only due to the new coronavirus
pandemic was in

on April 11th.
There were practical workshops there that explored open data about the
Covid-19 disease and built visualizations.

Another one was in
[Salvador](https://sites.google.com/view/openstreetmapdatadayufba/capa),
organized by the Federal University of Bahia. It was initially scheduled
to happen on March 7th, but was postponed initially for a week because of
strong rainfall in the city. But then all in person activities were
suspended a day earlier by the university due to the pandemic. So they
rearranged the event to happen completely online on June 10th. There were
many lectures, workshops and even artistic shows. Some talks were available
in both Portuguese and English languages. Most themes were related either to
open spatial data and collaborative mapping on Open Street Map or to data
about the Covid-19 disease.

Did I miss a Brazilian Open Data Day that happened in 2020 or before? If so,
drop me an email with the evidence and I'll add it to this narrative, and of
course give you credit.

## The current state of the Open Data Policy

The next talk was by Ot√°vio Neves of the Office of the Comproller-General,
who is responsible for the Brazilian federal government open data policy
since July last year, when Decree 9.903/2019 reassigned it from the
Ministry of Economy.
