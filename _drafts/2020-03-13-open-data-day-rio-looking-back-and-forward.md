A week ago I gave a talk at the Open Data Day event organized by the *Arquivo
Nacional*, the National Archives of the Brazilian federal government, to which
I had been invited. The theme was about the Open Data Day itself: what it is,
why is it important, and how have some previous ODD events been like.

## Getting to know the Open Data Day

For that talk, I took as inspiration a
[Guide for the Open Data Day 2020](https://github.com/okfn-brasil/embaixadoras/blob/master/Guia-ODD/Guia-ODD2020.md)
that the *Embaixadoras* project of Open Knowledge Brasil had produced, as a
result of a
[webinar](https://br.okfn.org/2020/01/13/open-data-day-2020-descubra-como-fazer-na-sua-cidade/)
I took part on in January. The [recording](https://youtu.be/MGceIuNm2xY) is
available on Youtube. In it, we discussed some tips for organizing an ODD
event.

The [Open Data Day](https://opendataday.org) is a decentralized event, where
people in many places around the world gather to celebrate open data and to do
activities related to open data. These activities vary a lot. They can be, for
instance:

* exploring data sets to get to know the possibilities of using them to solve
  real world problems;
* talks about any topic related to open data;
* hackathons, data analysis and software development in projects that use
  open data;
* round tables and Q&A sessions between data users and data publishers.

Why does it matter? Well, it's an opportunity to get people together to
discuss things related to open data. It's often the case that each one
works in their open data related project on their own, and don't know
what the others are doing or how they can benefit from cooperation. It's
a rare occasion where you have a critical mass of people interested in
open data who can work together to solve real world problems with data.

However, the ODD isn't just for experts. As it's an inclusive event, people
who have never had any contact with open data before can feel welcome and
figure out a way to help with something useful and meaningful. And, of course,
to learn and practice skills in an environment where it's easy to get help
when you need it.

Since the event is decentralized, you don't have to ask permission to plan a
new one in your community. Just think of a few things to do there, scheduling
a project or two that people might want to volunteer to. It's often the case
that people get in willing to collaborate, but have no idea about what to do.
So having some suggestions ready is something pretty useful. A talk to
introduce newcomers to the project is also important.

Send invitations to your event to communities that might be interested in
working on the project. Not only tech communities, but also ones related to
the field of work related to the project. If it's an environment related
project, get in touch with environment protection groups. If it's a health
or transportation issue, do the same.

If possible, try to invite also public officials responsible for publishing
the data. They'll get feedback on the data they published and data users will
get a better understanding of the data and get their questions answered.

Make sure you book the place in advance. Places can be public buildings,
universities, libraries, schools, etc. But also non-profit and corporate
places can often be used for free in non-working days (the ODD is usually on
Saturdays) if you tell them about the event and ask them. It's also very
important to make sure that the place does have a decent wifi for
participants to use. It will be frustrating for everyone if they can't
easily download data and tools for analysis. Don't leave these arrangements
to the last minute or your event might not happen.

Don't forget to announce the event to all of the relevant groups by direct
contact and by using social media. Also, head to opendataday.org and include
your event in the map there.
